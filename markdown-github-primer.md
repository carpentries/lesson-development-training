---

Before joining Collaborative Lesson Development training,
participants should be able to:

- write formatted text -
  bold and italic, headings, links, bullet point and numbered lists -
  with Markdown.
- log into GitHub.com and create and edit files using the GitHub web interface.

These skills can be learned by following two sections of the
[Building Websites with Jekyll and GitHub](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/jekyll-pages-novice/)
lesson in [The Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.org/):

1. [Introduction (starting from "Setting Up a Repository")](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/jekyll-pages-novice/introduction/index.html#setting-up-a-repository)
2. [Authoring with Markdown (skipping the optional exercises)](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/jekyll-pages-novice/markdown/index.html)
