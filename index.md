This is a training curriculum teaching good practices in lesson design and development,
and open source collaboration skills, using [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. 
The curriculum was designed to be taught over three full days or six half-days.
The target audience is Carpentries Instructors with an idea for a new lesson 
they would like to create,
especially if that lesson is intended for short-format training
(e.g. part or all of a two-day workshop).

We believe that lesson development is easier and more successful when it is
a joint effort among collaborators, 
so the activities and examples used in this training are best suited to groups
of trainees who want to collaborate on a lesson project.
Efforts have been made to also cater to lesson developers working alone.


## Learning Objectives

After attending this training, participants will be able to:

- collaboratively develop and publish lessons using The Carpentries lesson infrastructure 
  (aka [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]):
  lesson template, GitHub, GitHub Pages, etc.
- identify and characterise the target audience for a lesson.
- define SMART learning objectives.
- explain the pedagogical value of authentic tasks.
- create exercises for formative assessment.
- explain how considerations of cognitive load can influence the pacing,
  length, and organisation of a lesson.
- configure and maintain accessible and usable lesson repositories using best practices,
  readily available for collaboration.
- identify and correct accessibility issues in a Carpentries lesson.
- update and improve lesson material guided by feedback and reflection from teaching.
- review and provide constructive feedback on lessons.
