## About this training

_Collaborative Lesson Development Training_ is a new program being piloted by The Carpentries,
teaching the skills required to collaboratively create open source lessons using The Carpentries infrastructure.
The training will focus on three main topics:

1. Good practice in lesson design and development
2. Creating lesson websites with The Carpentries Workbench
3. Collaboration skills

Spread over six half-days, with an extended break between sessions 4 & 5,
participants will learn how to prepare an effective lesson to suit a defined target audience,
how to implement that lesson as an open source website using The Carpentries lesson infrastructure,
and how to collaborate and build community around a lesson project.
Participants will apply these principles as they are introduced during the training,
creating a sound foundation for their lesson in a series of hands-on exercises,
trialling newly-developed content, and preparing their lesson repository for collaboration.

## Who is this training for?

The pilot is aimed at teams of 2-4 people, wishing to collaborate on a new lesson.
At least one member of each team should be a certified Instructor, 
having completed The Carpentries Instructor Training,
or another training covering similar topics, e.g. an RStudio Instructor.

## Format & application

This training will take place virtually, combining video and screen sharing on Zoom
with a collaborative notetaking document for sharing notes, responses to exercises, and links to further resources.
