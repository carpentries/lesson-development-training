## Schedule

The curriculum was piloted in six half-days, 
with an extended break for lesson trial runs between half-days 4 & 5.

Below is a suggested six half-day schedule that can be used as a guideline to plan the content 
for each teaching session.

|----------------|-----------------------------|
| 09:00 - 10:05  | How to Write a Lesson       |
| 10:05 - 10:15  | Break                       |

| 13:00           | End                     |


From experience, half-days 5 & 6 can probably be delivered in less than the scheduled amount of time
and could potentially be folded into 1 half-day of teaching, for learner teams that are more experienced 
in working with GitHub.

## Training Themes

### Lesson Development as a Learning Process

A recurring theme in this training is the discussion of the benefits of piloting a new 
lesson and treating teaching as an opportunity to learn and improve the lesson. 
We have found it helpful to frame the discussion this way and to draw on our own experience 
when talking about the ways in which piloting a lesson can help to improve it.
For example, when teaching the assessments or narrative section you might discuss a time 
when you piloted a workshop and realized there was a concept missing in the demo/narrative
that learners needed in order to be able to complete the exercise.
