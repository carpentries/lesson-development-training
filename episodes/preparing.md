::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

After completing this episode, participants should be able to...

- Summarise lesson content as a teaching plan.
- Add Setup Instructions and Instructor Notes to the lesson site.
- Create a feedback collection plan.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What can I do to prepare to teach my lesson for the first time?
- How should I communicate lesson setup instructions to learners?
- What information should be recorded for instructors teaching a lesson?
- How should information be collected as part of the feedback process?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this episode, we will discuss how you can measure learner progress 
and gather feedback about the effectiveness of your content
by teaching the lesson.

By now you should have developed objectives, exercises/formative assessments,
and examples for at least one of the episodes in your lesson. In order to prepare to teach it (for the first time in particular) you'll need to create a teaching plan and design a method to collect feedback on your lesson.

## Teaching Plan

A teaching plan outlines the structure of your teaching session, including details, estimated duration and materials needed to deliver it. For example, a teaching plan may contain the following:

- welcome, introductions and motivation for the lesson - to introduce yourself, aims and objectives of the lesson and how it will help learners
- setup - to check if everyone is ready to proceed with the lesson
- segments of teaching and exercises from the lesson and any other planned activities (e.g. group discussions, wrap-up and feedback)
- checkpoints - places where you have planned to stop to check-in with learners
- slides, figures and other visual aids needed to deliver teaching and other parts of the teaching plan
- resources/references/recommended reading

## Checkpoints in a Teaching Plan

Checkpoints are especially useful at the beginning of a lesson
when you may not have as many exercises
but the learners need to have the data downloaded or tool opened to be able to follow along.
A checkpoint could include stopping to ask what questions learners have or having them
indicate if they have completed the most recent step shown by the instructor.

## Perspective on Preparing a Teaching Plan
*"I usually create detailed notes organised in a concept map/workflow in order to make everything consistent.
I also write next to each bit of teaching the time approximately needed.
For each lesson I create (and reuse when I teach again the same lesson)
very detailed notes of what happens during the lesson,
including teaching goals and learning objectives I mean to achieve with each bit of lesson.
This rich lesson plan requires a lot of work the first time I teach a lesson,
but reduces a lot the preparation time of future lessons and are super useful to other teachers."*

\- Dr. Allegra Via, Carpentries Instructor and Instructor Trainer

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: Prepare a teaching plan (15 minutes)

Create a bullet point list or brief notes describing
what you will say and do when teaching the episodes you have been focussing on
during this training.

You could create this teaching plan in a document just for yourself or write it into your Lesson Design Notes document.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Figures and other visual aids are great tools to help participants understand the content being presented and make associations between pieces of information.
The Instructor View of the lesson website includes a link in the top menu to _Extract All Images_,
providing a single page containing all of the images in the lesson and their captions:
this can be useful as an alternative to a slide deck when refering to figures and other visual aids during a workshop.

### Setup Instructions

If your lesson requires participants to use any software, tools or data, it is worthwhile 
investing time now into creating clear download, installation and setup instructions for 
participants to follow and circulating them ahead of the workshop. 
This will give you more time at the pilot for teaching the lesson as troubleshooting setup problems 
on the spot can be time-consuming and stressful. 
Each Carpentries lesson has a dedicated place for setup instructions within 
The Carpentries Workbench located in the file `learners/setup.md` off the lesson project root.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: Add Setup Instructions (10 minutes)

Add setup instructions (in the `learners/setup.md` file) 
with a list of software/tools/data needed by participants to follow your lesson 
and links on how to obtain and install them.

Rather than producing a separate page in the lesson site,
the contents of `learners/setup.md` 
will be combined with `index.md` to produce 
the Learner View of the landing page of your lesson.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Instructor Notes 

Another standard piece of The Carpentries Workbench are the *Instructor Notes* pages - 
intended to help you and other instructors deliver your lesson by providing useful tips for how 
to best run a workshop or explain "sticky" points in the lesson. 
Instructor Notes for your lesson are located in the `instructors/instructor-notes.md` file off 
your lesson project root - this page is displayed in the header menu when in "Instructor View".

You may consider adding the following information to your lesson's Instructor Notes:

- rationale, strengths and/or weaknesses of the lesson design
- what has been tried before and what worked/did not work
- tips for teaching the lesson/particular episodes
- challenges encountered
- troubleshooting common setup/installation/exercise issues
- parts that seem to cause trouble or most confusion for learners (i.e. where to tread carefully, spend more time explaining)

You can also add notes in a specific episode of the lesson using fenced div with tag "instructor".
Instructors can see such notes within the lesson and the "Instructor Notes" tab in the header menu 
of the website by changing the view in the upper right-hand corner of the lesson 
to "Instructor View". These notes are hidden when in 'Learner View'

It may initially be difficult to create Instructor Notes until you have taught the lesson yourself for the first time - but after the first pilot you will have enough feedback to draft them.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: Add Instructor Notes (5 minutes)

Add Instructor Notes (in the `instructors/instructor-notes.md` file) with an initial list of points 
that will help you and other instructors deliver the lesson.

Add a single instructor note in one of your episodes using the "instructor" fenced div. 

Then try out the "Instructor View" of your lesson and seeing the Instructor Notes in the 
header menu and the in-line hidden instructor note in your episode.

## Hidden Curriculum

The concept of **hidden curriculum** describes curricular effects that influence learning
but are not explicitly addressed in the lesson content -
e.g. (unofficial) social and cultural norms, behaviours and values
that are transferred by instructors to learners, often unconsciously.
These are all the additional things that people learn about the topic from *the way* your lesson is taught,
rather than from its official content.
It is worthwhile to spend some time thinking about what learners could pick up
from _the way_ your lesson is taught,
as well as from its written content.
You can use Instructor Notes to guide instructors on some of the aspects of the hidden curriculum of your lesson,
e.g. to encourage them to follow certain tried and tested practices.

## Feedback Collection Plan

There is a lot to collect feedback on when trialling a new lesson and this is arguably the most important part of your teaching plan. It can be hard to capture all this information yourself while you are teaching, hence you will need help from your team - make sure you assign the feedback collection roles ahead of your pilot. Additionally, when you are advertising your workshop, try and make it clear to the participants you are piloting a new lesson and that they will be actively helping you refine it as well as learning new things themselves. This can help focus their attention on the feedback you need to collect from them, which you should be doing:

- __constantly and throughout the workshop__
  - As notes taken by an observer/co-instructor - refer to the ["Pilot Workshops" episode](operations.md#pilot-workshops) for suggestions on things to track and the [pilot workshop notes template][pilot-notes-template] and other suggested feedback collection mechanisms to help you gather such information.
  - As "minute card" feedback from learners - minute cards are short comments from learners on what is working well and what could be improved, provided frequently (e.g. at the end of each session). Like exercises used as formative assessment, minute card feedback can be provided by learners while there is still time for instructors to act on it and adjust their approach. You may find [the Virtual Minute Card template][minute-card-template] helpful for workshops run online, and [the Instructor Training curriculum describes how sticky notes can be used at in-person events][it-minute-cards].
- __at a designated wrap-up and feedback session at the end of the workshop.__ Here, you can cover any other feedback that was not addressed up to that point and any specific questions you may want to ask your audience (e.g. about the choice of topics for the lesson, difficulty level, workshop operations). You may design a special form that participants can fill in anonymously - here is a [post-workshop survey template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OGCQBotD2nOJkc7KpFZLhFfb3EBcxEDwHz_3p48qz3U/template/preview) for workshops that pilot a lesson in The Carpentries Incubator. You can use it as a starting point for a post-workshop survey to be shared with your learners at the end of the pilot workshop and you can supplement it with additional questions.

### Training Pilot Operations Guide

You may find the ["Training Pilot Operations Guide"](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14066425)[^1], compiled by the [Software Sustainability Institute][ssi] and [UNIVERSE-HPC project][universe-hpc], a useful resource to have a look at as you prepare to pilot your lesson.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

We recommend that you look for an opportunity to teach some or all of your new lesson as soon as possible.
The feedback you collect and the experience you gain will help you improve on your lesson design and content.

### Testing with a 'Real' Audience

Presenting our lesson in front of a ‘real’ audience as a trial run gave us valuable feedback on things we hadn't fully considered in the planning phase.
It helped us to better understand how much time is needed for the exercises, how difficult the exercises are for the learners and how some examples used can be misunderstood by the learners.
I think that learner feedback is more useful the more the audience closely matches your own target audience, so the insights are more practical and relevant for improving the content.

### Getting Feedback Early

Doing a trial run of our lesson so early in the process felt a bit intimidating at first, it seemed like we weren’t ready and everything needed more work. But that’s exactly why the trial run was so helpful.
It gave us a clear picture of what worked and what didn’t, like realizing we’d packed in way too much content and spotting some technical issues we hadn’t thought of before.
The participants were understanding and gave us really useful feedback, which made the next version of the lesson so much better.
It was a great reminder that progress matters more than perfection.

### After the training

Before obtaining certification as a Carpentries Lesson Developer, trainees are required to complete two "checkout" tasks:

1. Teach one or more episodes of your lesson to a real audience.
2. Join a _Pilot Workshop Debrief_ session, reporting on your experience teaching your new lesson and your plans for the next iteration of the content and design.

See the [Checkout Process](../learners/checkout.md) page for full of these steps.

![
To complete their Carpentries Lesson Developer certification, participants in this training must attend a Pilot Workshop Debrief session and report on the experience of trialling some of their new lesson content.
Participation in a separate GitHub Skill-up teaching skills and approaches for effective collaboration is optional but recommended for Lesson Developers.

Some feedback from participants that demonstrates the importance of piloting a lesson.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  discussion

## What questions do you have? (15 minutes)

The checkout process for Lesson Developer certification includes a pilot event of at least one of the episodes you have been developing in your lesson, to a real audience.

After reading [the information provided about the checkout tasks](../learners/checkout.md) and thinking about the lesson pilot, what questions do you have about how you should approach teaching it?
Is there anything you are unsure of?
What resources might help you prepare for that experience?


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Spending time on preparing your teaching and feedback collection will make you and your participants get the most out of your workshop pilot.
- Creating clear setup instructions as part of your lesson and circulating them ahead of the pilot is time well-invested and will give you more time when teaching the lesson.
- Instructor Notes are teaching tips that you should include with your lesson to help you (a few months down the line) and other instructors, who have the relevant topic knowledge but have not been involved in the lesson design and development, deliver your lesson more successfully.
