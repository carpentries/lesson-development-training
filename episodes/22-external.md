::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What makes a project welcoming for newcomers?
- What information should I provide about the project to potential collaborators?
- How can I ensure regular progress on lesson development?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Documenting your lesson

For collaborative projects, it is important to spend the time on ‘external-facing’ features, such as documentation, to make the project as welcoming and as easy to get involved in as possible for newcomers who may not have a deep grasp of the project or know all its existing problems. Such documentation will be useful to yourself and other team members at well, e.g. if you are trying to come back to the project after a break or are reusing it for a new collaboration in the future. 

Your lesson documentation should contain the following information, which should be kept up to date.

### Description of the project - `README` file

`README.md` file (located in the root directory) is the first piece of documentation that people will land on when visiting your lesson repository. It should concisely explain what the lesson is about and who it is for, and contain links and pointers to further information, including:

  - **rendered version of the lesson** - even though this is typically included in the `About` section of the repository, it is always useful to link to the URL where the rendered lesson is visible.
  - **contact information** - include email addresses or mailing lists or other details on how to get in touch with the lesson maintainers.
  - **contributing** - this is an opportunity to list what kinds of contribution are sought and how to get involved in lesson development for new contributors. You can provide more details in a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` file within the repository’s root directory and link to it from `README`. 
  - **credits/acknowledgements** - where appropriate, be sure to credit those who have helped in the lesson's development or inspired it, and/or any resources/templates that you have reused. You can also link to a separate `AUTHORS.md` file within the repository’s root directory, to list all the people who contributed to the lesson content (especially if this list starts to become too large to include in `README`). 
  - **citation** - it’s a very good idea to specify a reference to an appropriate academic publication so others can cite the use of the lesson in their own publications and media. You can do this within a separate `CITATION.md` file within the repository’s root directory and link to it from `README`.
  - **licence** - a short description of and a link to the lessons’s licence typically contained in a separate `LICENSE.md` file within the repository’s root directory.

### Instructions for contributors - `CONTRIBUTING.md`

`CONTRIBUTING.md` is a file within the repository's root directory where you should provide detailed description of what kinds of contribution will be credited and in what ways. For example, at what point would someone be listed as an author and how you will credit contributions that are not recorded in the commit history of the project. The latter is particularly important for newcomers who may not be proficient with the use of GitHub's features for collaborative work, such as issues, mentions, pull requests and code review, but could still provide valuable input and contributions. 

### Issue and pull request templates

Consider setting up issue and pull request templates to help newcomers who may not have much experience working on collaborative projects in GitHub. Such templates will prompt them to fill in answers to pre-set questions, which will help raise issues or submit pull requests in a way that’s clear, helpful and provides enough information for maintainers to act upon (without going back and forth to extract it). GitHub provides a range of default templates, but you can also [write your own](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository).

### Other documentation

Once have set up the basic documentation about your lesson, you may consider adding the following useful information to your documentation too:

- set-up guides for installing and rendering the lesson locally
- how to create and modify the pages in the lesson


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge
## Exercise: preparing your repository for collaboration (15 minutes)

Spend some time doing **one of the following**:

1. Modify the `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files in your repository
   to provide the relevant information for would-be contributors to your lesson:
   - the name(s) of the current developer(s), linked to their GitHub profile(s) (README)
   - contact information (README, CONTRIBUTING)
   - guidance on how people should contribute, and what kinds of contribution you are most interested in receiving (CONTRIBUTING)
   - links to any important background information (README)
   - links to any funding bodies or host institutes that are supporting the development of the lesson (README)
2. Create a new issue or pull request template, or modfy an existing one,
   to guide contributors on how best to begin collaborating with you on GitHub.

## Collaborating on a lesson
 
### Boosting the visibility and attracting new collaborators

In addition to having the complete documentation in the lesson repository, the Carpentry community provides a number of ways to further raise the visibility of the lesson among the broader community and to encourage community members to contribute to its further development, for example:

  - listing the lesson on [The Carpentries Help Wanted page](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/)
  - featuring your lesson in [the Incubator Lesson Spotlight](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/spotlight.html)
  - writing a blog post about the lesson for [the Carpentries Blog](https://carpentries.org/blog) or attending a community discussion call to promote the lesson
  - advertising the lesson at various Carpentries mailing lists - e.g. [general discussion](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss), [instructors](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors), regional communities or specific curriculum lists

You should also consider submitting your lesson to [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and similar wider community open source events aimed at encouraging people to contribute to open source projects periodically throughout the year.

### Issue labelling for newcomers

You can encourage contributions to your lesson from newcomers by using specific labels on issues to highlight suitable opportunities to help. Apply the `good_first_issue` or `help_wanted` labels to issues in your repository to indicate that the maintainers will welcome help or pull requests fixing such issues.

### Noticing when something happens

GitHub implements a comprehensive [notifications system](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications) to keep you up-to-date with activities in your lesson repository. GitHub also provides an additional useful notification feature for collaborative work - **mentions**. The mention system notifies team members when somebody else references them in an issue, comment or pull request - you can use this to notify people when you want to check a detail with them, or let them know something has been fixed or changed (much easier than writing out all the same information again in an email!). You can use the mention system to link to individual GitHub accounts or whole teams for mentioning multiple people. Typing `@` in GitHub will bring up a list of all accounts and teams linked to the repository that can be "mentioned".

Check out [GitHub's documentation on setting notifications on individual repository](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository). You can choose whether to watch or unwatch an individual repository, or can choose to only be notified of certain event types such as issues, pull requests, mentions, etc.


### Making progress

The following practices have been shown to help maintain steady progress with lesson development: 

  - being responsive to notifications about activities and mentions 
  - scheduling regular co-working/sprinting sessions with team members
  - attaching your sprint sessions to other open source community activities, such as [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), which offer goodies, rewards and prizes for participants, will provide motivation and activity spikes
  - attending Carpentries Maintainer co-working/lesson development co-working sessions with people working on or maintaining other lessons
  - blocking time in your calendar for issue triage/solo material writing
  - planning lesson pilots in advance to help set targets 


Make sure to join the [Incubator lesson developers mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/incubator-developers) to keep an eye on announcements and discussions relating to lesson development in the Carpentry community.

## Exercise: planning to collaborate (10 minutes)

Use this time to plan how you will continue to make progress
with developing your lesson, and ensure that you are ready to respond to
external contributors when they arrive at your lesson.
This time is yours to do with as you think is best for yourself and your project,
but you might consider using it to do one or more of the following:

1. schedule a lesson development co-working session with your collaborators,
   and/or mark the next community co-working session in your calendar.
2. ensure that your the notification settings are appropriately configured for
   your lesson repository.
3. contact The Carpentries team to ensure issues from your lesson will be
   included on the Help Wanted page.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- *"If a project doesn’t make a good first impression, newcomers may wait a long time before giving it a second chance" - Karl Fogel, the author of ["Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/producing-open-source/0596007590/)*.
- You should make an active effort to attract potential collaborators and try to make them all feel welcome and included. [The Carpentries Help Wanted page](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/) and featuring in [the Incubator Lesson Spotlight](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/spotlight.html) can boost the visibility of your lesson. Creating the appropriate documentation and using GitHub features such as labels, and issue/pull request templates will help lower the barriers for contributions to your project.
- Scheduling regular co-working sessions, blocking time in the calendar for issue triage, and setting and being responsive to GitHub notifications will ensure regular progress on the lesson.
