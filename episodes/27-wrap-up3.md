## Looking Ahead

We have reached the end of this training.
By now, you should have made good progress towards a first draft of your lesson.

Referring back to [the life cycle stages for lessons](19-operations.md) 
described earlier in the curriculum, 
the lesson is still in _pre-alpha_ but hopefully approaching _alpha_,
when it is ready to be taught in full for the first time.

As you and your collaborators continue to iterate over the lesson -
teaching it, gathering feedback, reflecting on the experience, 
and improving it for next time -
the lesson will pass through _alpha_ into the _beta_ and _stable_ stages
(perhaps via [peer review in The Carpentries Lab][carpentries-lab]).

Your role as the original developers of the lesson,
and the kind of interactions/contributions taking place on your repository,
will change as you move through these stages.

In particular, as the lesson becomes more mature,
you may find that the suggestions made by would-be contributors are 
increasingly difficult to fit into the lesson (e.g. due to time constraints in a workshop)
or that changes suggested are not aligned with the design decisions made earlier
in the lifetime of the project
(e.g. not suited to the target audience of the lesson, or superfluous to the defined objectives).

In such circumstances, it is important that lesson maintainers are prepared to say "no" 
and to say it gracefully.

If you receive a pull request or issue that does not fit to your lesson,
consider the following points to help you politely decline 
without demotivating the contributor from contributing to your lesson 
(or another open source project) again:

1. **Thank them** for taking the time to contribute.
2. **Explain why the contribution does not fit** into the lesson, 
   and offer suggestions for improvement if you're able.
3. **Link to relevant documentation**, if you have it.
   Notes about the design of the lesson (e.g. from this training) and 
   any relevant discussion threads can be very helpful here.
   If you notice similar repeated requests/contributions, 
   you might want to address them in your documentation
   (e.g. in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file) to save yourself time in future.
4. **Close the request**.

The advice above is taken from [The Carpentries Maintainer Onboarding curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/02-communicate-contributors/index.html).
That resource, and [the _Best Practices for Maintainers_ guide from GitHub](https://opensource.guide/best-practices/#learning-to-say-no) on which it is based,
make excellent further reading as you prepare to transition from your role as an active developer
into another as a responsive and responsible maintainer of your lesson.


## Farewell and Feedback

Thank you for following this training.
We hope you found it helpful to build a foundation for your current lesson project
and to prepare you to collaborate on other projects in the future.

To bring the training to a close, 
the Trainers will lead a number of activities to gather feedback 
and help you reflect on the experience.

::: challenge

## One Up, One Down (10 min)

Provide one up, one down feedback on the entire Collaborative Lesson Development Training. 
Remember:

- Say only one thing, and try not to duplicate.
  This gets harder for those who come later!
- Trainers should try not to respond, only record responses (e.g. in the Etherpad). 
  This is also hard, but important!

# Reflection exercise (15 min)

Take this time to reflect on what you have learned in this last part of the training,
and take some action to plan to successfully complete the development of your lesson
after you leave.
It is up to you how you use this time, but you might find some inspiration in the prompts below.

- How could you use the project management features of GitHub to 
  prepare for the next stage of the lesson development process?
- If you have been working in a collaborative group,
  what steps could your group take to improve the way you work together
  for the remainder of the project?
- If you have been working on the lesson alone so far,
  what steps could you take to find new collaborators to help you 
  with the further development of your lesson?
- Based on the experience of teaching a section of your lesson,
  do the objectives you wrote for your lesson still seem realistic?
  Can you identify anything that can be added or removed 
  now that you have completed a trial run?

:::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Documenting your lesson project, curating your lesson repository, welcoming new contributions, and taking advantage of GitHub's project management features all make it easier for people to collaborate with you.
- Any lesson can be improved with feedback, including this one.
