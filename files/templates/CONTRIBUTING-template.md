# Contributing

<!-- TEMPLATE INTRODUCTION
This template is adapted from the standard CONTRIBUTING.md used by The Carpentries. Feel free to replace/modify/reuse as much or as little of it as you like, but we recommend that you used the headings and overall structure as a guide to ensure that you include all the most important information.
-->

This is an open source project and we welcome contributions of all kinds: fixes to existing material, bug reports, constructive additions to existing discussions, and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.


## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our
license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess
your change proposal as promptly as we can, and help you become a member of our community. Everyone involved in the project agrees to abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## Who Should Contribute?

Contributions to this curriculum are welcome from anyone with an interest in the project.


## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1. If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account, you can [send us comments by email][contact]. However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you use one of the other methods described below.

2. If you have a [GitHub][github] account, or are willing to [create one][github-join], but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues]. This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3. If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material, you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for doing this are [included below](#using-github).

Note: if you want to build the website locally, please refer to [The Workbench documentation][workbench-docs].


## What to Contribute (This Lesson)

The lesson is relatively new and under active development/refinement, so any contribution will be welcome.
Ideas for how the existing content could be improved or updated, and/or errors that need to be corrected will be particularly useful, and we are certainly open to suggestions for new content and all other kinds of feedback.
Comments on existing issues and reviews of pull requests are similarly welcome.

If you plan to submit a pull request, please open an issue (or comment on an existing thread) first to ensure that effort is not duplicated or spent making a change that will not be accepted by the Maintainers.


## What *Not* to Contribute (This Lesson)

Although most contributions will be welcome at this stage of the lesson's development, the time available to deliver the content in a training event is strictly limited and needs to be accounted for when considering the addition of any new content.
If you want to suggest the addition of new content, especially whole new sections or episodes, please open an issue to discuss this with the Maintainers first and provide the following information alongside a summary of the content to be added:

1. A suggested location for the new content.
2. An estimate of how much time you estimate the new content would require in training (teaching + exercises).
3. The [learning objective(s)][cldt-lo] of this new content.
4. (optional, but strongly preferred) A suggestion of which of the currently-used learning objectives could be removed from the curriculum to make space for the new content.

## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute]. In brief, we use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:

1. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each significant change.
2. Commit the change in that branch.
3. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
4. Submit a pull request from that branch to the [upstream repository][repo].
5. If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.

NB: The published copy of the lesson is in the `main` branch.

Each lesson has a team of maintainers who review issues and pull requests or encourage others to do so. The maintainers are community volunteers, and have final say over what gets merged into the lesson.

### Merging Policy

Pull requests made to the default branch of this repository (from which the lesson site is built) can only be merged after at least one approving review from a Maintainer.
Any Maintainer can merge a pull request that has received at least one approval, but they may prefer to wait for further input from others before merging.
