<p>Using correct names and pronouns (e.g. “she/her”) is important to
setting a tone of respect. Learning these is hard to do quickly, so we
recommend displaying it prominently during the workshop.</p>
<p>In an online workshop, give everyone a moment to update their display
name to reflect how they would like to be addressed.</p>
<p>At an in-person event, we recommend supplying name tags and markers,
or using plain paper to create table-displayed name placards.</p>
<p>Note that pronouns are personal and some participants might prefer
not to share them. Do not force people to share their pronouns.</p>

taught over three days (six half days), with an extended break between
the first two days (“part 1”) and the last day (“part 2”). The training
in part 1 focusses on good practices in lesson design and development,

Carpentries lesson infrastructure. Part 2 of the training begins with a
reflective discussion of lesson deisgn and iterative development, before
shifting focus to the skills required for effective collaboration on
open source projects.</div>
</figure><p>During the training, we will introduce the steps you can take to
design and develop a lesson to meet the needs of your target audience,
and give you time to begin implementing those steps during the workshop
itself. By the end of the training, you can expect to have defined an
outline for your whole lesson, and begun filling in a detailed plan for
some of its individual sections. The content you create in the training
will exist as an open source lesson website similar to <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/" class="external-link">the
one this training is based on</a>. You should also know how you can
continue building on the lesson and some plans for how you will
collaborate on the project after the training ends.</p>
<p>We will focus on three main areas:</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to design an effective lesson, we need a structured approach
with the learner in mind and clearly identified goals. Throughout this
training, we will use a modified version of Nicholl’s five phase
paradigm for curriculum design<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Nicholls’ paradigm describes a process,
commonly referred to as <em>backward design</em>, where those who wish
to develop a new curriculum first begin by defining exactly what their
learners will be able to do <em>after they have completed the
lesson/training/course</em>. The subsequent stages of the curriculum
design process involve designing content to directly meet those stated
outcomes.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select learning outcomes</li>
<li>Choose learning experiences to help learners achieve these
outcomes</li>
<li>Develop content to support these experiences</li>
<li>Assess learner progress towards desired outcomes</li>
<li>Evaluate chosen outcomes, experiences, and content based on this
assessment</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="../fig/nicholls-five-phases.svg" style="width:67.0%" alt="A flow diagram presenting the Nicholls' five phases of curriculum design as a cycle." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Nicholls’ five phases of curriculum design,
presented as a cycle to reflect that all aspects of the design should be
revisited in response to the results of the evaluation that takes place
at step 5.</div>
</figure><p>The last two phases of Nicholls’ paradigm involve assessing learner
progress towards the desired learning outcomes and evaluating the stated
objectives and current content in light of the results of that
assessment. In The Carpentries, most workshops are relatively
short-format, without room for an extensive assessment after the
teaching has finished (a <em>summative</em> assessment). To account for
this, our lessons place an emphasis on <em>formative</em> assessment:
assessment of learner progress that takes place <em>while the teaching
is still going on</em>, to give instructors opportunities to evaluate
the teaching and lesson content before the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>To account for this, we have adapted Nicholls’ five phases in this
training, to place an emphasis on assessing learning during a
workshop:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define desired learning outcomes</li>
<li>Design assessments to determine progress towards desired
outcomes</li>
<li>Write content to lead learners from one of these assessments to the
next</li>
<li>Assess learner progress towards outcomes during teaching</li>
<li>(After the break) evaluate how closely the outcomes meet the
objectives</li>
</ol>

design and development , adapted from Nicholl’s five phases, that will

</figure><p>Note the cyclical nature of this process: you will complete one
iteration through this cycle during this training (though probably for a
limited part of your lesson, rather than the whole thing). Note also
that teaching the content is an essential intermediate step in the
process: the importance of feedback gathered while teaching the lesson
will be a common refrain throughout this training.</p>

<p>The Carpentries community develops open source lessons, which can
always be updated and may never be <em>finished</em>. A lesson can
undergo many iterations before it reaches a relatively stable state. To
reflect this, we encourage lesson developers to indicate the status of
their lesson by labelling its progress through a <em>lesson life
cycle</em>:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/life_cycle.png" alt="Diagram of the life cycle of a lesson in The Carpentries ecosystem. A lesson is proposed at the beginning of the pre-alpha stage.

Pilot workshops take place during the alpha and beta phases." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The life cycle of a lesson</div>
</figure><p>Each life cycle stage indicates the level of maturity of a
lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>pre-alpha</strong>: a first draft of the lesson is still

<li>
<strong>alpha</strong>: the lesson has been/is being taught by the
original authors, but has not been fully tested.</li>
<li>
<strong>beta</strong>: the lesson is ready to be taught by
instructors who have not been significantly involved in its developed to
this point.</li>
<li>
<strong>stable</strong>: the lesson has been extensively tested by
the authors and others. It can be considered broadly complete and
unlikely to undergo any drastic changes without warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although your lessons will probably remain in pre-alpha throughout
this training, some of the content will be equally valuable at later
stages and we will also point you towards resources to help with testing
the lesson and gathering feedback.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Given the limited time in a short-format training, it is vital to
define the scope of the lesson, i.e. what people need to know before and
what they will know after the lesson. Thinking carefully about the
target audience will help you with this and defining desired learning
outcomes (the first step of the lesson design). Prominently displaying a
description of the target audience will also help attract people with
the right motivation and relevant prior knowledge to attend your
workshops.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="expertise">Expertise<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#expertise"></a>
</h3>
<p>One of the most important things we can identify about our target
audience is the level of expertise they will already have in relation to
the skills taught by your lesson. In The Carpentries Instructor Training
curriculum, we describe <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#the-acquisition-of-skill" class="external-link">three
different stages of skill acquisition: novice, competent practitioner,
and expert</a> and how it directly correlates to the complexity of <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#building-a-mental-model" class="external-link">mental
models</a> these different groups have about a domain/topic.</p>
<p>Briefly, the novice is someone who does not know what they do not
know, i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or
how they relate, the competent practitioner has enough understanding of
the domain/topic for everyday purposes, and the expert is someone who
can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary and can
immediately use their prior knowledge or skills when presented with a
new problem in the domain.</p>
<p>When designing a new lesson, it is important to think about the level
of expertise that you expect learners to arrive with for two
reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It helps to predict what prior knowledge and <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#building-a-mental-model" class="external-link">mental
model</a> learners will have of the lesson domain when they arrive. This
can enable you to make progress quickly by
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>working to help learners recall (<em>activate</em>) that prior
knowledge<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>,</li>
<li>building on the conceptual understanding they already have<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and,</li>
<li>perhaps most importantly, giving you some idea of what
<em>misconceptions</em> they might arrive with. It is vital that
misconceptions are identified and corrected early on, before learners
try to incorporate new knowledge into a broken mental model. (More on
this in <a href="formative-assessment.html"><em>Stay On
Target</em></a>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>People at different stages of this process need to be taught
differently. For example, novices will learn more from lessons that
include worked examples and are more tutorial-like i.e. focused on a
specific task, with step-by-step explanations of the process, but
without a lot of extra information that is not directly relevant.
However, the same approach may actually hinder learning for competent
practitioners who may be distracted by a step-by-step explanation of
something they already have the prior knowledge of<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. For learners at this
level of expertise, lessons which include activities offering learners
the freedom to explore options and develop their own solutions, are
likely to be more effective.</li>

<p>Furthermore, your lesson will be more effective if it aligns with the
motivations of the target audience. Understanding the wants and needs of
your target audience, what they know already and what kinds of problems
they want to solve, will help you design a lesson that learners can see
the value in. It will give them the impression that taking the lesson
will be worthwhile (called <em>positive expectancies</em> in the
literature).</p>

<p>It can be tempting to identify a target audience only in vague terms,
for example by writing that a lesson is aimed at “PhD students” or
“early career researchers”. However, taking the time to focus on real
people, or imagined personae, who represent your target audience will
help you take time to consider the various aspects that can influence
how much someone will learn from your lesson. It will also help you
notice when the assumptions you are making about your target audience
are unreasonable.</p>
<p>Most of all, it will help you stay connected to the fact that <em>you
are not your learners</em>: they will arrive at the lesson with
different priorities, interests, and challenges than your own.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>A very common challenge encountered in workshops is heterogeneity of
expertise among the audience. When learners arrive at a workshop with a
wide range of previous experience with the topic, it is difficult for
the instructors to keep everyone engaged. Those who arrive with too
little relevant knowledge and experience can struggle to follow the
lesson content at the pace you expect, while those who arrive with too
much are likely to become bored and despondent as their expectation of
learning new skills is not met.</p>
<p>One way to try to guard against this is to publish the description of
your target audience when you advertise a workshop teaching your lesson,
alongside a list summarising the skills and conceptual knowledge you
expect learners to arrive with. Another is to use the information you
have about your target audience to ask questions of potential learners
when they apply/register to join the workshop (like the diagnostic
questionnaire you may have prepared in the exercise above), and use the
answers they give to filter out those who fall outside your intended
audience.</p>
<p>While valuable, this kind of pre-assessment should be approached with
caution: people are often bad at self-assessment i.e. estimating our own
ability to perform a task<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. We can try to mitigate for this when
designing the questions for a pre-workshop survey, leaving little room
for inaccurate self-assessment to confound the results. But experience
suggests it is very difficult to ensure that every learner in a workshop
falls within the intended audience of a lesson.</p>

the target audience is for your lesson, and what knowledge, skills, and
abilities you expect them to arrive with. Now it is time to consider the
additional knowledge, skills, and abilities they will have by the time
they leave: these are the <em>learning outcomes</em> of your lesson. It
can feel strange to jump from one end of the process to the other like
this, but clearly defining your goals early in the lesson development
process is vital. As we will see in this episode, it helps you to
determine the activities, examples, etc. that are appropriate for the
lesson content, and provides a scope for what should and should not be
included.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="why-focus-on-skills">Why Focus on Skills?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-focus-on-skills"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To ensure your audience stays motivated, and your lesson feels
relevant to them, we recommend that lessons focus on teaching skills
rather than tools. Lessons should be centred around what you are
empowering learners to <em>do</em>, what will be most beneficial to
them, rather than a list of functions or commands you are teaching them
to use. Placing the emphasis on skills over tools will help you
prioritise key concepts and consider how your lesson can have the
biggest impact on the way learners do their work.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-objectives"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The desired outcomes (the <em>learning objectives</em>) of a lesson
should be new skills, i.e. things that the learner can do. For the vast
majority of lessons, these will be <em>cognitive skills</em>: things
learners can do with their minds. (Lessons intended to teach other kinds
of skill, such as woodwork, playing a musical instrument, or making
sushi, are probably better suited to a different platform than a static
website.) Cognitive skills cannot be equally easily acquired: before we
can <em>apply</em> concepts and <em>create</em> something new, we must
attain the ability to <em>remember</em> and <em>distinguish</em> between
new concepts. Remembering and distinguishing are also abilities that are
often faster to gain then applying or creating.</p>
<p>We must try to be realistic about how far along this scale we can
move learners during a single workshop/lesson. This is one reason why
the target audience is so important: if we can predict what learners
will know when they arrive at the lesson, we can better define the
outcomes we can expect when they leave.</p>
<p>Defining objectives for a lesson is essential because it allows us to
focus the rest of our time on developing content that is necessary for
learners to reach these goals. It will help us ensure we do not miss
anything important or, conversely, include anything superfluous that
could use up valuable time or distract instructors and learners.</p>

<p>Each objective starts with a verb and describes one (and only one)
skill the learner will obtain.</p>
<p>For objectives to be as helpful as possible, they need to be written
in a way that will allow us to directly observe whether or not a learner
has attained the skills we want them to. This means that the skills
described by our objectives should be measurable: as a general rule,
action verbs such as “explain,” “choose,” or “predict,” are more helpful
than passive verbs such as “know,” “understand,” or “appreciate”, which
are hard to directly assess and are often open to interpretation.</p>
<p>A popular aid for defining learning objectives is <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/" class="external-link">Bloom’s
Taxonomy</a>, which divides cognitive skills into several categories.
The original taxonomy arranged these categories in a strict hierarchy,
which has since been disputed. Regardless of whether these skills
conform to such a hierarchy, Bloom’s Taxonomy serves as a very useful
bank of action verbs for use in learning objectives. The Committee for
Computing Education in Community Colleges has also created a <a href="https://ccecc.acm.org/assessment/blooms-for-computing" class="external-link">version of
Bloom’s Taxonomy customized for computing related training</a>.</p>
<p>We will see how helpful it can be to use action verbs in learning
objectives when we begin talking about exercise design in the coming
episodes.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To assist you in defining and writing learning objectives for your
lesson, it can be helpful to turn to a popular framework for defining
goals: <em>SMART</em>. Originally <a href="https://community.mis.temple.edu/mis0855002fall2015/files/2015/10/S.M.A.R.T-Way-Management-Review.pdf" class="external-link">proposed
to aid managers in the definition of business goals</a>, and updated and
adapted since to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria#Common_usage" class="external-link">several
other domains</a> including education (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5944406/" class="external-link"><em>How to
Write Well-Defined Learning Objectives</em></a> for example<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>), the
SMART acronym requires goals to be <em>specific</em>,
<em>measurable</em>, <em>attainable</em>, <em>relevant</em>, and
<em>time-bound</em>.</p>
<p>In the context of a lesson, SMART objectives should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>S</strong>pecific: they should clearly describe a particular
skill or ability the learner should have.</li>
<li>
<strong>M</strong>easurable: it should be possible to observe and
ascertain when the learner has learned the skill/abilities described in
the objectives.</li>
<li>
<strong>A</strong>ttainable: the learner should realistically be
able to acquire the skills or abilities in the time available in a
workshop/by following the text of the lesson.</li>
<li>
<strong>R</strong>elevant: they should be relevant to the overall
topic or domain of the lesson as a whole.</li>
<li>
<strong>T</strong>ime-bound: they should include some timeframe
within which the goal will be reached. For learning objectives, this is
built into the approach described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, for any lesson/curriculum that will be taught in a fixed
amount of time, <em>attainable</em> and <em>time-bound</em> are
overlapping: learning objectives for your lesson will answer the
question “What will learners be able to do by the end of this lesson?”
and the time available to teach the lesson, combined with the expected
prior knowledge of your target audience, will determine how attainable
they are.</p>

<p>Objective 1 is the closest to what we ideally want in a lesson
objective, but it illustrates how difficult it can be to make an
objective truly specific. For example, a more specific and measurable
version of this objective could be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>write links, headings and bold and italicised text with
Markdown.</em></p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>One of the major challenges of lesson design is choosing what to
include in a lesson: what the main points will be, in what order they
will be introduced, how much detail can be provided, and how much time
can be spent on each point. Especially when writing lessons for short
form training like a Carpentries workshop, difficult decisions often
need to be made about what can and cannot be included. Trying to fit too
much content into a lesson is counter-productive<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, so it is good to
avoid the temptation to cram in more content than you have time to cover
properly.</p>
<p>Writing learning objectives is a good opportunity to begin thinking
about this lesson scope, and can provide assistance when you are faced
with a difficult decision about what content to cut out.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the order in which new skills must be
acquired. Before learners can begin to acquire “higher-level” cognitive
skills to perform creative and analytical tasks, they must first acquire
the foundational knowledge and conceptual understanding of the domain.
Furthermore, these higher-level skills take longer to acquire so, unless
you can expect your target audience to arrive at the lesson with the
relevant foundational knowledge and understanding, it is probably
unrealistic to aim to have learners completing creative tasks before its
end.</p>
<p>As should become clear through activities in the upcoming episodes,
lessons can be broadly considered as blocks of content associated with a
particular learning objective. This can be helpful when making choices
about content to remove, because the task can be considered in the
context of taking out whole learning objectives.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We have discussed the importance of defining objectives early in the
lesson design process, and looked at some examples of objectives written
for other lessons. Now it is time to begin defining objectives for your
own.</p>
<p>Here are some recommendations to help you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim for 3-4 lesson objectives for every 6 hours your lesson will
take to teach. (For example, this curriculum is designed to be taught in
~18 hours and has <a href="index.html#learning-objectives">ten learning
objectives</a>.)</li>
<li>These objectives are for your lesson as a whole: try to define the
“end point” knowledge and skills you want learners to acquire. You can
think of these as the things you would test in a fictional “final exam”
your learners would be able to tackle.</li>
<li>Later you will write “episode-level” objectives that should define
intermediate steps towards the high-level objectives you identify for
your lesson here.</li>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Write learning objectives for your lesson into the relevant section
of your Lesson Design Notes document - what do you want learners to be
able to do at the end of the workshop? When writing these lesson-level
objectives, try to follow the SMART framework: make them specific,
measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.</p>
<p>Take notes about the your discussion in your Lesson Design Notes
document. A record of the decisions you made and your reasons for
choosing these objectives can be very helpful for you and others to
understand the design and scope of the lesson later.</p>
<p>If you find yourself writing very specific <em>episode</em> level
objectives, keep them in your notes and try to think of a slightly
broader objective that may contain several very specific objectives. We
will come back and work more on episode objectives next in the
training.</p>

<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="creating-a-narrative">Creating a Narrative<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-narrative"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<!--- Should this section go before LO and questions? --><p>Writing your lesson as a story helps learners stay motivated and
engaged. The story you create can also help learners more easily connect
how the skills they are learning now could be useful after the workshop.
You can enable learners to make connections between what they learn in
your lesson and their own work by creating a narrative that resembles a
situation the learners might encounter there.</p>
<p>Here are some example narratives from lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html" class="external-link">Software
Carpentry Git lesson</a> uses the story of Wolfman and Dracula who have
been hired by Universal Missions (a space services spinoff from Euphoric
State University) to investigate if it is possible to send their next
planetary lander to Mars. They want to be able to work on the plans at
the same time, but they have run into problems doing this in the past.
They now need a system that will enable them to work collaboratibely and
in parallel and track each change.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/jekyll-pages-novice/filters/index.html" class="external-link">Building
Websites With Jekyll and GitHub lesson</a> uses the narrative of
creating a website for a research project to teach authoring webpages
with Markdown and compiling them into a website served on GitHub.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-research-software/" class="external-link">FAIR
Research Software lesson</a> uses the narrative of a poorly designed
software project (which analyses <a href="https://data.nasa.gov/Raw-Data/Extra-vehicular-Activity-EVA-US-and-Russia/9kcy-zwvn/data_preview" class="external-link">NASA’s
open data on spacewalks</a> undertaken by astronauts from 1965 to 2013)
that over the course of the lesson gets improved in terms of its
accessibility, readability, interoperability and reusability to become
more FAIR</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, a single and continuous narrative threads through the
entire lesson, while other times, you use a mini-narrative to teach a
specific point in an episode. For example, within the overall narrative
of creating a research project website in <a href="https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/jekyll-pages-novice/filters/index.html" class="external-link">Building
Websites With Jekyll and GitHub lesson</a>, there is a mini-narrative of
creating a series of short blog posts to teach how to extract a class of
structurally similar pages into a common layout template and filter out
common structural components of pages.</p>
<p>You may find that images and figures enhance your narrative. Images
are powerful communicators, conveying a lot of information with few or
no words. Images can also be distracting for learners. If you choose to
include images as part of the narrative of your lesson, be sure that
they are consistent with the situation you are describing so that they
do not increase learners’ cognitive load.</p>
<p>Depending on the tool you are teaching, you might also include a
particular dataset as a part of the story you are weaving into your
lesson. It is common for lessons to include a dataset that is used in
examples and discussed throughout. This can help you maintain a
narrative flow and make the lesson feel more authentic. Even if your
topic doesn’t require a dataset, deciding on a consistent narrative will
help create a flow between episodes and reduce cognitive load for
learners.</p>

<p>The focus of this episode is on finding one central example to be
used throughout a lesson. However, where you wish for learners to
develop understanding of more abstract concepts, you should try to
provide a variety of examples with a common theme. This could be
achieved by providing multiple opportunities to recognise and apply the
concept in taught examples, activities, and exercises.</p>

<p>Copying an image from a website is technologically simple but can be
legally and ethically complex. Images are intellectual property and are

<p>When looking for images that illustrate the narrative of your lesson,
avoid copying images that do not include a reuse license. Assume that
you cannot reuse these images unless you seek written permission from
the image creator or owner. Instead, look for images that indicate that
they are in the public domain or carry a permissive reuse license such
as CC0 or CC-BY. Public domain images can be freely reused and adapted.
Images carrying a reuse license can be used and adapted in accordance
with their license terms.</p>
<p>If you cannot find reusable images that match your narrative, you can
create your own images or seek help from others in the Carpentries

numbers, columns names etc on my own.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When searching for a dataset to use in your lesson, there are a
number of factors to consider. First, if possible you want the dataset
to be an authentic use case for researchers in your target audience.
This means balancing the size and complexity of a dataset while avoiding
additional cognative load for learners. The dataset may need a certain
number of observations to demonstrate some of the skills you are
teaching or have a number of variables that is sufficiently similar to
what learners may encounter in their work to feel authentic. At the same
time, you want your learners to be able to interpret the data fairly
easily during the lesson so they can focus on the skills you are
teaching. This may mean you will need to subset your dataset by removing
some observations (rows) or variables observed (columns).</p>
<p>You may also want to include and review a data dictionary in your
lesson, explicitly taking the time to review the information included in
the dataset. For inspiration, see the <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/socialsci-workshop/data.html" class="external-link">Social
Sciences Data Carpentry data dictionary</a>. An additional factor to
consider when choosing a dataset to include is the license. You want to
find a dataset where the data provider allows for you to freely use it.
The best option is a dataset with a CC0 (Public Domain Dedication)
license, as other licenses may have more ambiguity around data reuse.
Lessons included in <a href="https://carpentries-incubator.org/" class="external-link">The
Carpentries Incubator</a> are encouraged to use CC0 licensed data, and
may be required to do so to qualify for peer review in <a href="https://carpentries-lab.org/" class="external-link">The Carpentries Lab</a>. Even with a
CC0 license, you will still want to follow best practice in giving
attribution to the data provider or collecting agency.</p>

research project’s data that was simplified for teaching. The reuse of

<li>The <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#social-science-curriculum" class="external-link">Social
Sciences Data Carpentry lessons’</a> dataset is the <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/SAFI_Survey_Results/6262019" class="external-link">teaching
version</a> of the full Studying African Farmer-Led Irrigation (SAFI)
dataset. The SAFI dataset represents interviews of farmers in Mozambique
and Tanzania, conducted between November 2016 and June 2017. The
interviews surveyed household features (e.g. construction materials used
for dwellings, number of household members), agricultural practices
(e.g. water usage) and assets (e.g. number and types of livestock). The
teaching version of the SAFI dataset has been simplified and
intentionally “messed up”” to enable demonstrating common data cleaning

<p>When deciding on a dataset, it is also important to consider the
ethical use of each dataset. <em>Does the data contain personally
identifiable information?</em> <em>Was the data collected without
permission from the groups or individuals included?</em> <em>Will the
data be upsetting to learners in the workshop?</em> If the answer to any
of these questions might be yes, you will need to do more research on it
and continue to look for other options. Commonly data is misused from
historically excluded and exploited groups. The CARE Principles for
Indigenous Data Governance<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control,
Responsibility, and Ethics) are good starting point for thinking about
data sovereignty and considering the ethics of data collected about an

<h3 class="callout-title">Exercise: Choosing a Dataset or Narrative (30 minutes)</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Referring to the advice given above, find an appropriate dataset or a
narrative for your lesson. Identify one or more potential candidates and
note down the advantages and disadvantages of each one. As a reminder,
here are some aspects we suggest that you consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>For datasets:
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>complexity</li>
<li>“messiness”/noise</li>
<li>relevance to target audience</li>
<li>availability</li>
<li>license</li>
<li>ethics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For narratives:
<ul>
<li>authenticity</li>
<li>relevance to target audience</li>
<li>complexity</li>
<li>possibility to teach useful things first/early</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Takes notes in your Lesson Design Notes document about your
discussion and the decisions made. It may be particularly helpful to
record:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which datasets and narratives did you consider?</li>
<li>How and why did you choose between them?</li>
<li>What implications do you think your choice of dataset and/or
narrative will have for the design and further implementation of your
lesson?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>People learn faster if they are motivated<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and learners will be
motivated if you <strong>teach most useful things first</strong>. As you
think about what story your lesson will tell, it is important to put the
pieces that are most interesting to learners up front. If they are able
to quickly learn tools or skills that they see as useful from your
lesson, they will be more interested in continuing to learn other
concepts that are needed. You may notice this trend in many of the
Software Carpentry lessons. In particular, many of the coding language
lessons (R and Python) have the learners create a plot very early in the
lesson and then go back and teach coding fundamentals such as loops and
conditionals. Visualization of data is often a very motivating and much
needed skill by learners. Getting to visualization early, keeps learners
interested in learning the additional and vital skills where the
application might be less clear.</p>

<p>Remember, even if you do not need a dataset for your lesson, you
should decide on a narrative. Centering your lesson around a central
example reduces the cognitive load of switching between examples
throughout the lesson. Using an authentic, yet simple, dataset will also
help reduce cognitive load and help learners to see how they might apply
what they learned to their own projects. It is also important to
consider licensing and ethical considerations when looking for a lesson
dataset.</p>

<p>After completing this episode, participants should be able to…</p>
<ul>
<li>identify appropriate parts of their lesson to break into individual
sections</li>
<li>define learning objectives for a section of a lesson.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So far, you have defined the learning objectives for your lesson as a
whole, and came up with a narrative or example datasets that will help
you tell your story.</p>
<p>Rather than write the lesson as a single, long document, we recommend
that you break it up into chunks like chapters in a book or episodes in
a season of a TV series. This can help manage learners’ cognitive load
by ensuring that you organise content into coherent, more self-contained
chunks, and makes it easier for instructors to schedule regular and
frequent breaks while teaching. Thinking about how content can be broken
down like this early in the lesson design process helps you to consider
the path learners will take to reach your defined objectives, and
identify the component skills and knowledge they will need to pick up on
the way.</p>
<p>In The Carpentries, we refer to these individual parts of a lesson as
<em>episodes</em>, to encourage lesson developers to think about them as
self-contained units (with their own narrative arc) that nevertheless
contribute to the larger whole (the theme or story that runs through a
full season). It also helps to think about the typical length of an
episode: these chunks contain 20-60 minutes of content (teaching +
exercises).</p>
<p>Each episode will exist as a page in the website we will build for
our lessons.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="planning-your-episodes">Planning Your Episodes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#planning-your-episodes"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Before we can start creating the episodes of a lesson, we need to
spend some time planning out the number and order of them. The learning
objectives you defined for your lesson can help with this: at the very
least, it is probably a good idea to have one episode dedicated to each
objective. You might also find that you can “decompose” the lesson-level
objectives into more finely-grained steps that learners can take towards
those end points. For example, the lesson-level objective</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“create formatted page content with Markdown”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>may be broken down into,</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“create bold, italic, and linked text with Markdown”</em></li>
<li><em>“explain the different header levels in Markdown”</em></li>
<li><em>“add images with a caption and alternative text description to a
Markdown document”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Some questions you might ask yourself to help break down your
lesson-level learning objectives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What new knowledge and skills will learners need to acquire to be
ready to fulfil the overall objectives for your lesson?</li>
<li>What order should these concepts and skills be introduced in? Are
some dependent on others?</li>
<li>If some of these concepts and skills are complex, can they be broken
down even further?</li>

<p>With your team, in the shared notes document for your lesson:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Based on the lesson-level objectives and your knowledge of the
lesson topic, divide the lesson up into logical blocks (episodes), that
should each take approximately 20-60 minutes to teach. Think of these
logical blocks as topics that you need to cover within your lesson but
do not go too deep into defining learning objectives for individual
episodes - we will cover that soon.</li>
<li>Next, assign responsibility for one of these episodes to each
collaborator in your team. They will focus on this episode for the rest
of this training, and you will teach these episodes in a trial run
between parts 1 and 2 of this training.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the length of the list of episodes you create is smaller than the
number of collaborators you have on your team, try assigning two people
to a single episode, with each taking responsibility for a subset of the
objectives defined for that episode. If you plan more episodes than you
have people in your team, do not assign more than one episode to each
collaborator for now, but <strong>we strongly recommend that you assign
yourselves consecutive episodes at the beginning of your
lesson</strong>.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now that we have broken those lesson-level learning objectives into
episodes, we can use the same approach for the individual episodes of a
lesson, defining objectives for the episode to make clear what we intend
to teach in that section. Defining these objectives <em>before writing
the episode content</em> helps us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>stay focused in the episode, without spending time on non-essential
topics</li>
<li>determine whether learners are attaining the skills we wish to teach
them (we will discuss this more in the next two episodes)</li>
<li>summarise the skills the learner can expect to gain by following
this section of the lesson</li>
</ul>
<p>As before, here are some recommendations to help you define these
episode-level objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim for 2-4 objectives per episode. If you need to write more than
that, consider breaking this section down into multiple episodes.</li>
<li>To ensure your episode content aligns with the overall goals for the
lesson, try to identify which lesson-level objective(s) your episode
will contribute to.</li>
<li>In the context of the previous recommendation, consider how the
objectives for your episode fit as a component of the higher-level
skills/understanding defined in the lesson-level objective(s).</li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to measure progress and evaluate if and what learning
occurred, we have various types of assessment available to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>summative assessments</strong> - used to verify whether
learners achieved the stated learning objectives <em>after</em>
instruction.</li>
<li>
<strong>formative assessments</strong> - used to detect changes in
learner understanding or performance <em>during</em> instruction, to
provide feedback and insight (to both instructors and learners) into the
learners’ developing mental models of the topic taught and to identify
any old or developing misconceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summative assessments</strong> sum up what learning has been
achieved after training (e.g. via exams). They give valuable data about
learning attainment by individuals and entire cohorts but are not used
to guide further progress of a lesson. They may not be as suitable for
short courses, but may be necessary for those that give marks/grades or
certificates of completion.</p>
<p><strong>Formative assessments</strong> are applied throughout a
course and with several different purposes: they provide a way to move
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/05-memory.html#using-formative-assessment-to-support-memory-consolidation" class="external-link">new
information from working memory to long-term memory</a>; they can inform
instructors’ decisions about how to modify instruction to better promote
learning; they also inform learners about changes they may need to make
to improve their learning. Ideally, they should be used often
(e.g. after every 15-20 minutes of teaching), providing opportunities to
instructors to change pace and refocus learners’ attention. For short
courses, formative assessments are usually more valuable and easier to
implement in practice than summative assessments - they need not be
complex or time-consuming, just informative enough about learning for
both instructors and learners.</p>
<p>The most effective way to test learner understanding and progress is
to do such assessments in class - they engage all learners and allow
instructors to check learners’ confidence with the content and its
delivery, can help you deal with any potential misunderstandings as soon
as they arise, and maximise the value of workshop for everyone. Such
formative assessments also help with <em>metacognition</em> - the
awareness a learner has that they are succeeding in learning something
new.</p>
<p>Any instructional tool that generates feedback and is used in a
formative way to check for learners’ understanding can be described as
“formative assessment”. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>checking in</strong> - gauging learners’ satisfaction and
understanding using agreed signals (e.g. raising different coloured
post-it/sticky notes or <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/#reactions" class="external-link">Zoom
reactions</a> to indicate that the pace is too fast/slow, that they
completed/have not completed an exercise).</li>
<li>
<strong>group or collaborative discussions</strong> - raising
questions for discussion among the group. For example, <strong>think,
pair, share</strong>, where learners <em>think</em> individually about
an answer to a question, <em>pair</em> up with a classmate to discuss
their answer, and then <em>share</em> out the consensus they came to
with the class.</li>
<li>
<strong>problem-solving or diagnostic exercises</strong> - setting
(coding or non-coding) challenges for learners to tackle, testing
comprehension of a subject and diagnosing any forming misconceptions
(e.g. via multiple choice questions).</li>
<li>
<strong>individual (guided) reflections</strong> at the end of a
session to help process what was learned, for example asking learners to
write down, draw, or diagram (concept map) things they learned, noting
how things relate to one another or connect with previous knowledge,
things they want to know more about and any questions they still
have.</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In a simplified model of memory individuals are equipped with two
types of memory: working (also called short-term) and long-term.
Long-term memory essentially has unlimited storage but is slow to
access, whereas working memory is quicker to access but can only hold a
limited number of items at a time. For teaching, the goal is to help
learners move the new things they’ve learned from working memory into
long-term memory. Exercises help with this by providing learners an
opportunity to practice what was recently learned. Exercises should
occur frequently throughout the lesson to free up working memory and
make space for more new information.</p>
<p>Creating exercises builds upon the learning objectives you created
earlier in the lesson design process. You can design exercises based on
the actions/skills you described in your learning objectives (the
learning outcomes you intend for the lesson). This will be easier if
your wrote learning objectives with specific action verbs. Specific
verbs can help you decide what action you want the learners to perform
in the exercise. E.g. actions such as “explain” and “describe” may be
better assessed by discussions and multiple choice questions, while
“solve,” “construct,” “test” and other higher-level cognitive skills may
be better assessed by debugging tasks, <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#code-run" class="external-link">code-and-run</a>,
or use-in-a-different-context exercises.</p>

<p>As you discussed with your group in the last exercise, different
types of learning objectives work better for novices, while others are a
better fit for competent practitioners or experts.</p>
<p>This can be understood in terms of the types of exercises that suit
the objective: exercise types that help manage cognitive load for the
learner, such as <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#fill-in-the-blanks" class="external-link">fill-in-the-blanks</a>,
<a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#faded-examples" class="external-link">faded
examples</a> or <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#parsons-problem" class="external-link">Parsons
problems</a> (which all provide a lot of the guiding process/scaffolding
code and allow the learner to focus on a specific concept or skill) are
a good fit for a novice, to whom all elements of the topic are new.
However, these kinds of exercise do not provide an opportunity for
learners to develop higher-level skills, such as the ability to create
whole new functions or scripts, or to extrapolate from the examples they
have seen to solve a different kind of problem. Indeed, example and
exercise types that are helpful to novices may even be
counter-productive for learners with a greater level of expertise<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Thus you want to choose your objectives to fit your intended audience
and your exercise formats to fit your objectives.</p>

<p><em>“Different types of lesson objectives (LOs) are better fit for

and if exercises (formative assessments) are well aligned to LOs, [they]
will automatically serve the corresponding audience. Thinking in terms
of LOs (What should a learner do in order to achieve this specific LO?
Is this LO exactly what learners are expected to achieve by the end of
this piece of instruction? etc.) is easier than thinking in terms of LOs
+ audience + content. LOs should be tailored to the audience, and, if
this is well done, you may stop worrying about the audience. Create LOs
for the specific audience and create assessments for specific
LOs.”</em></p>

<p>Using one of the exercise formats you have learned about so far,
design an exercise that will require learners to perform one of the
actions described in the objectives you wrote earlier, and that assesses
their ability to do so.</p>
<p>These should be assessments of the lower-level objectives defined for
individual episodes in the lesson, as opposed to the lesson-level
objectives you wrote first.</p>
<p>Trainees working as a team can choose whether to work together on
discussing and designing a single exercise to assess a single objective,
or to divide their efforts and each focus on an exercise for their own
episode. If you choose to take the latter approach and finish with time
to spare, spend the remainder reviewing and providing feedback on one

<p>The same approach to designing exercises within a lesson can also be
used to create a short “pre-assessment” questionnaire for potential
learners to complete when they register for a workshop teaching the
lesson (or for self-evaluation before following the lesson on their
own). You can use <a href="audience.html#defining-prerequisite-knowledge">the list of
prerequisite knowledge that you defined earlier</a> to help with
this.</p>
<p>If you collect the results of this questionnaire, use it to follow up

the workshop will be for them.</p>

<p>You should aim to create all your assessments before you have written
the explanatory content of your lesson (recall Nicholls’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design" class="external-link">backward
design</a>). These assessments will guide your lesson design process by
knowing exactly which knowledge you’d expect from your learners at any
point in the lesson.</p>
<p>Well-designed exercises are one of the most valuable resources for an
instructor and any time spent on this during lesson design is well
invested.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Explanatory text (including examples) help connect your exercises
together into a cohesive lesson. If your exercises are train stations
and scenic views, the explanatory text is the train tracks that connect
them. Often times the examples and exercises may seem like a good draft
for you to teach. However, the explanatory text makes it possible for
other instructors and self-directed learners to follow along by
providing all the relevant information directly in the lesson. It can
also help you remember your goals and stay on track teaching.</p>
<p>How much text to include is often a question of personal style while
balancing the needs of potential users, both other instructors and
learners. You want to find the balance between providing enough
information for learners to meet the learning objectives without
increasing cognitive load with extraneous information. In this section
we will discuss factors to consider when you are writing explanatory
text.</p>
<p>There are trade-offs to consider when preparing a site for use as an
instructional guide vs use as a self-directed learning resource.
Typically, self-directed learning resources are more verbose where
instructional guides are aimed at an audience that can fill in the gaps
on their own. However, very sparse text is less likely to be re-usable
by other instructors as instructors may have different skill levels with
the lesson content or differing mental models. In general, it is not a
good idea to assume others, learners or instructors, will know what you
were thinking when you wrote the content so, if in doubt, be
explicit.</p>

<p>In the Software Carpentry Plotting and Programming with Python Lesson
there is an exercise to load and inspect CSV file for Americas. In the
lesson, before the exercise, the Instructor demonstrates an example of
how to load the data table for another continent (Oceania) and explores
the values with a few different functions. This shows learners how to
call the function to load the CSV into a data frame, and demonstrates
what success looks like for their exercise.</p>
<p>In the Python Interactive Data Visualization Lesson in the Incubator,
there is an exercise to find the correct widget (a slider) for an action
and modify the script to use it. In the lesson, before the exercise, the
instructor introduces a cheatsheet and documentation for interactive
widgets and then creates a dropdown widget for the application. The
slider widget required in the exercise has not been demonstrated but the
preceding example shows all of the necessary steps to add a widget, and
provides the supporting information that learners can consult to

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Trying to fit too much content into a lesson is counter-productive.
It is better to cover less and provide a smaller but stable foundation
for learners to build upon.</p>
<p>You should also consider a realistic workshop length for teaching
your lesson. It is difficult to keep learners attentive for many hours
over many days. Most Carpentries workshops are two work days of lesson
material as it is difficult for learners to attend 4 full days of a
workshop. Although, there are some in the community who will run
workshops that are three days to cover additional material.</p>
<p>As you consider the length of your lesson discuss with your
collaborators and ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is essential to include?</li>
<li>What can be left out if needed?</li>
<li>Are there checkpoints where the lesson could end if needed?</li>
<li>Can important concepts be moved up earlier to ensure they are
covered?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, the only way to know for sure is to teach the lesson,
measuring how long it takes to teach. Borrowing from television, The
Carpentries community calls these early workshops, pilot workshops. As
you run pilot workshops, you can note the length of time spent in each
episode. You might find the <a href="https://codimd.carpentries.org/lesson-pilot-observation-notes-template#" class="external-link">template
for notes on pilot workshops</a> helpful as it includes a table for
episode and exercise timings. Instructors commonly report running short
on time in workshops. Thus, it is better to assume that you are
under-estimating rather than over-estimating the length. It is better to
have additional time for discussion, review, and wrap-up than to rush
through material to fit it into the remaining time.</p>
<p>If, after piloting your new lesson, you find that you did not have
time to cover all the content, approach cutting down the lesson by
identifying which learning objectives to remove. Then take out the
objective(s) and the corresponding assessment(s) and explanatory
content. You may consider making a <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#mapping-a-mental-model" class="external-link">concept
map</a> to help identify which objectives depend on one another.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you decide to keep certain objectives in the
lesson, you can add suggestions on which objectives can be skipped to
the Instructor Notes for the lesson. Instructor Notes are meant to
convey teaching tips and advice to other instructors teaching your
lesson and will be discussed in more detail later on in section <a href="preparing.html">“Preparing to Teach”</a>.</p>
<p>As you add notes and think about what to cut, remember, reducing the
number of lesson objectives can help with managing learner (and
instructor) cognitive load.</p>

three stages of the lesson design. You should have a clear idea of who
the people are that you want to teach this lesson to, and what exactly
the skills are that you want them to learn while they are following it.
You also have an outline of your lesson and its episodes. It is now time
to begin creating a website that will present that lesson to the
world!</p>

<p>The source of all The Carpentries lessons is made publicly-available
in repositories on <a href="https://github.com/" class="external-link">GitHub</a>. By making
our repositories public like this, we encourage others to help us
maintain and improve our lessons, and make it as easy as possible for
them to re-use and modify our lessons for their own purposes.</p>
<p>GitHub provides a hosting service to open source projects such as
these, allowing users to present their projects to the wider world. The
repository includes a complete history of the changes made between
versions of the individual files in the project, and provides many
features that facilitate collaboration on projects. We will learn more
about some of those collaborative features later in this training. For
now, we will focus on one other important feature that GitHub provides:
website hosting.</p>
<p>Via a system called <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, users can build
and host websites from the files present in any repository on GitHub.
For many years, this has been how The Carpentries presents its lesson
websites to the world.</p>

<div class="accordion-body">
<p>In the past, our lesson sites were generated by software called
<em><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="external-link">Jekyll</a></em>, a tool built into
GitHub Pages that allows the webpage content, written in the text files
of the repository, to be combined with descriptions of settings,
structure, and styling, to create a website. The template used by Jekyll
to structure and style lessons was initially developed in 2013/2014 by
Abby Cabunoc Mayes, Greg Wilson, Jon Pipitone, and Michael Hansen for <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/" class="external-link">Software Carpentry</a>. It was <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/styles/graphs/contributors" class="external-link">expanded
and maintained by many members of the community</a> over almost a
decade, to also support <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/" class="external-link">Data
Carpentry</a>, <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/" class="external-link">Library
Carpentry</a>, and many other lessons.</p>
<p>In 2022, we adopted a new infrastructure for our lesson sites:
<strong>The Carpentries Workbench</strong>. Lesson sites built on the
Workbench are still hosted with GitHub Pages, but no longer use Jekyll.
Instead, the lessons are built using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" class="external-link">a programming language,
<em>R</em></a>, and <em><a href="https://pandoc.org/" class="external-link">pandoc</a></em>, a
software designed for converting content between file formats. The
Workbench combines three R packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper/" class="external-link">sandpaper</a>: converts a collection of Markdown or
RMarkdown files into the structure of a lesson website.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/" class="external-link">varnish</a>: provides the files and folders that add
styling and additional functionality to a lesson website.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/pegboard" class="external-link">pegboard</a>: a programmatic interface to the lesson,
enabling various automated validation tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>For lesson developers, the Workbench makes The Carpentries lesson
repositories much simpler to navigate and work with.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-lesson-repository">Creating a Lesson Repository<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-lesson-repository"></a>
</h3>
<p>To get started, we first need to create a new repository for our
lesson. We will use a template to do this, so that the new repository
contains the basic files and folders that the Workbench needs in order
to build a lesson site. There are currently two templates to choose
between:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-template-md/" class="external-link">A
Markdown template</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-template-rmd/" class="external-link">An
RMarkdown template</a>, best suited to lessons you expect to include R
source code that will generate output.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>One member of each participating lesson team</strong> should
choose one of these templates, following the link above and completing
the configuration as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>click on the green “Use this template” button near the top right of
the window</li>
<li>add a name for the repository
<ul>
<li>The name should be descriptive but fairly brief, with hyphens
(<code>-</code>) to separate words</li>
<li>the name can always be changed later, via the repository
settings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>make sure the “Include all branches” box is checked to copy all
branches from the template repository
<ul>
<li>this is important as lessons are developed in branch
<code>main</code> but rendered into websites from branch
<code>gh-pages</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in the “Description” field, write the title of your lesson</li>
<li>choose “Public” visibility</li>
</ul>
<p>After pressing the <em>Create repository</em> button, you should be
presented with a brand new lesson repository, like in the picture
below.</p>

<li><code>CITATION.cff</code></li>
<li><code>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</code></li>
<li><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code></li>

branch should never be modified by anyone other than the automated
actions-user account.</p>
<p>To see the rendering of the <code>gh-pages</code> branch by the
automated actions-user, you can click the “Actions” tab from the main
repo page. This tab shows the actions triggered by each commit and if
they are in-progress or completed (sucessfully or with an error). You
can also see the details of actions in more depth by clicking on an
individual commit in this page.</p>

<p>On the repository home page (e.g. by clicking the name of the project
near the top left of the window), click the gear wheel icon near the top
right, to edit the <em>About</em> box. Check the box that says “Use your
GitHub Pages website” to add the address of your lesson site to the
About box.</p>
<p>After following these steps, when you navigate to the pages URL, you
should see a lesson website with The Carpentries logo and “Lesson Title”
in the top-left corner. You may need to wait a few minutes for the
website to be generated.</p>

<code>config.yaml</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#config-yaml"></a>
</h4>
<p>The lesson title can be adjusted by modifying the
<code>config.yaml</code> file in the repository. The
<code>config.yaml</code> file contains several global parameters for a
lesson - to determine some of the page styling, contact details for the
lesson, etc. <code>config.yaml</code> is written in <em><a href="https://yaml.org/" class="external-link">YAML</a></em>, a structured file format of
key-value pairs in the form <code>key: value</code>. For example, a YAML
file of personal data might include lines such as
<code>name: 'Mei'</code>, <code>height_m: 1.84</code>, and
<code>birthdate: 1899-01-12</code>. As well as the title of the lesson,
you can and should adjust some of the other values in
<code>config.yaml</code>, but you should not need to add new values or
learn a lot about YAML to be able to configure your lesson. You should
also only have to add or modify single-line string values and list
entries, and not deal with multi-line strings or other data types
(e.g. numbers, booleans, dictionaries) that YAML supports. The template
<code>config.yaml</code> aims to guide users through examples and
annotations on how to format the values they provide e.g. if you are
modifying a value wrapped in quotation marks in the template file, it is
safest to replace it with another value within quotation marks.</p>

<p>The “home page” of a lesson is created from the <code>index.md</code>
file: this file should contain a brief introduction to the lesson,
designed to give visitors to the page a first impression of the lesson
and whether it is appropriate for them. The file begins with a short
header, written in the same key-value pair syntax we encountered in
<code>config.yaml</code>.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">

<div class="accordion-body">
<p>You might have noticed by now that GitHub provides a preview of
content in Markdown files, and displays an interpreted (“rendered”)
version of Markdown file content by default in its web interface. You
might also notice that the content of <code>index.md</code> is displayed
differently when viewed on GitHub from how it appears on the homepage of
your lesson website: the header mentioned above appears in a tabular
layout on GitHub, but is not visible on the lesson homepage.</p>
<p>This is because the lesson infrastructure accepts an expanded set of
elements in the source Markdown files: syntax for components of a lesson
website that are not part of the standard set of Markdown features,
e.g. page metadata such as the YAML header above, or blocks to make
exercises and solutions visually distinctive. In these cases, you may
see GitHub render the content differently from how it appears on your
website, or not at all.</p>
<p>We will encounter more examples of this throughout the lesson, but
the important thing to remember for now is that <strong>how GitHub
displays source (R) Markdown files is not a reliable indicator of how
content will be displayed in your website</strong>.</p>

<p>To get started on this home page, replace the template text with the

<p>As we’ve discussed previously, the main body of the lesson is written
in <em>episodes</em>: the individual chunks or sections that the lesson
is separated into. The episode pages of the lesson site will be
constructed from Markdown files in the <code>episodes</code> folder of
the lesson repository.</p>
<p>The <code>episodes</code> folder of the new repository contains a
single file, <code>introduction.md</code>. The content of this file
includes examples of how to write Markdown files for The Carpentries
Workbench.</p>
<p>There are two important things to note:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Like <code>index.md</code>, the episode file begins with a short
header. The fields in this header describe the episode title and the
estimated time (in minutes) required to teach it and complete the
exercises.</li>
<li>The example content includes several lines that start with strings
of colons (<code>:::::::</code>). These mark the beginnings and ends of
structural elements within the page, called <em>fenced divs</em>, which
get rendered in a visually distinct way on the lesson website. Each
fenced div starts and ends with a string of at least 3 colons (“:::”)
and the word at the end of the starting colons (the fenced div’s tag)
indicates what kind of block it is. <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/instructor/component-guide.html#callout-blocks" class="external-link">There
are many types of fenced divs in the lesson infrastructure</a> and we

episode title appear under <em>Chapters</em> in the left sidebar
navigation of your lesson site after refreshing the webpage. Clicking on
that title will take you to the episode page built from the file you
created. At the top of the page body, you will find the episode title
and an <em>Overview</em> box containing a list of the questions and
objectives defined for the episode. Later, we will add more content to
your chosen episodes.</p>

<p>To create an exercise in The Carpentries Workbench, we use another
two types of ‘fenced divs’:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>discussions</code>, where the main task is for participants to
discuss a topic or prompt, and</li>
<li>
<code>challenges</code>, where the main task is a problem to be
solved.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to start a challenge fenced div, use at least 3 colons,
followed by the <code>challenge</code> tag. Then the content of the
challenge is included on the following lines. Finally, you need to close
the fenced div using another line with least 3 colons.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb7">

</div>
<p>If you also want to include an expandable solution box for the
challenge you can nest a <code>solution</code> fenced div within the
<code>challenge</code> div. The format is the same as for a challenge
except the fenced div tag is <code>solution</code> instead. Note the
solutions can all be expanded for more accessible reading using the
“Expand All Solutions” option at the top of each episode.</p>
<pre><code>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Challenge Title

<p>For readability, you may want to have the length of the closing lines
match the opening lines. See in the above how the challenge and the
nested solution’s closing lines are similar lengths to the their
corresponding opening lines. For more information about creating

<p>Often lessons have more content than can be reasonably taught in the
amount of time allotted. This is especially true for collaboratively
developed lessons as each contributor/instructor may have additional
items they’d like to see included, leading to “scope creep”.</p>
<p>To address this issue, in many Carpentries lessons, spoiler boxes are
used for asides and short tangents, e.g. points that might be relevant
to some audiences but are not essential to the flow of the lesson. These
spoilers should still be kept to a minimum as they can be disruptive to
instructors and readers.</p>
<p>Note, this use of the spoiler box is to use the expandable box
functionality as nothing will be “spoiled” by expanding this box. Also,
note that the spoiler box titles should be very clear so instructors
need not expand the spoiler to know if they want to teach that
extra.</p>

<p>Sometimes, formatting errors and typos in the files of your
repository can cause the process that builds your lesson website to
fail.</p>
<p>You will likely first notice the failure to build the lesson if the
lesson website is not showing the changes you made. You may also receive
an email from GitHub about the build failure if that is your preferred
way of receiving notifications (but it may take you some time to realise
this). The good thing is that GitHub keeps your previous lesson version
online until the error is fixed and a new build is completed
successfully. If you are not yet familiar with the GitHub interface, it
can be difficult to pinpoint the problem.</p>
<p>Here are some points of advice that you can follow to help find and
fix the problem when you notice the build process fail.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you first notice that there is a problem, <strong>stop</strong>
editing your lesson: any subsequent changes that you make will not be
included in your lesson site until the problem is fixed, and might
introduce additional issues, making it more difficult to find the
original cause.</li>
<li>
<strong>Look at the history</strong> of commits (the link with a
reversing stopwatch icon and “NN commits” at the top of the listing of
files and folders in the repository homepage). Is there a place where
the build has a red cross instead of green circle? If so, click on that
commit to look at the “diff” (where it shows which lines have been
modified). The error is likely to have been introduced by these
changes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ask for help</strong>: you can open an issue on your
repository and tag a member of The Carpentries team to ask for help
finding the problem. Alternatively, you can also ask for help in The
Carpentries Slack workspace. (More about communication channels for
discussing lesson development coming later in this training.)</li>
<li>Waiting for the GitHub Actions process that builds the website to
run can be tedious, and slow down the process of troubleshooting: it can
take a few minutes for the process to reach the point where it
encounters the problem. It can be helpful to download the files for your
lesson and try to <strong>build a version of the website on your local
computer</strong>, where the build process will be much faster. The
Workbench documentation provides <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/#installation" class="external-link">instructions
for installing the infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/introduction.html#preview" class="external-link">building

<p>In line with <a href="audience.html">the importance we placed on
evaluation of lesson content earlier in this training</a>, the life
cycle described above places considerable emphasis on the testing of
lessons in <strong>pilot workshops</strong>.</p>
<p>For these pilot workshops to provide an effective evaluation of the
lesson, it is essential to seize the opportunity they provide to collect
feedback and data. For example, a pilot workshop offers a chance to
answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much time does it take to teach each section of the lesson?</li>
<li>How much time is required for each exercise?</li>
<li>What technical issues were encountered during the lesson?</li>
<li>What questions did learners ask during the workshop?</li>
<li>Which parts of the lesson were confusing for learners?</li>
<li>Which exercises could be improved to provide more information to the
instructors?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://codimd.carpentries.org/lesson-pilot-observation-notes-template#" class="external-link">The
pilot workshop notes template</a> provides a starting point, but it
takes a lot of time and effort to keep track of all this information
during a pilot workshop. It can be helpful to assign this task to a
member of the lesson development team, who can dedicate themselves to
observing the pilot and taking notes. As soon as the pilot has finished,
it is a good idea to take some time to share the notes with the other
lesson authors, to reflect on and discuss the experience of teaching the
lesson, and to synthesise the lesson notes and any action items that
come from this debrief into specific action items to improve the lesson.
These should be added as new issues on the lesson repository, to help
you keep track of the work that needs doing for the next iteration.</p>
<p>For beta pilot workshops, where the lesson is taught by instructors
who have not yet made a major contribution to its development, it is
vital that instructors have the opportunity before the workshop to learn
about the lesson from the authors, and to debrief with the authors
afterwards so that they can share their experience and observations
about how the lesson could be further improved.</p>

</figure><p>By now you should have developed objectives, exercises/formative

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A teaching plan outlines the structure of your teaching session,
including details, estimated duration and materials needed to deliver
it. For example, a teaching plan may contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>welcome, introductions and motivation for the lesson - to introduce
yourself, aims and objectives of the lesson and how it will help
learners</li>
<li>setup - to check if everyone is ready to proceed with the
lesson</li>
<li>segments of teaching and exercises from the lesson and any other
planned activities (e.g. group discussions, wrap-up and feedback)</li>
<li>checkpoints - places where you have planned to stop to check-in with
learners</li>
<li>slides, figures and other visual aids needed to deliver teaching and
other parts of the teaching plan</li>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Checkpoints are especially useful at the beginning of a lesson when
you may not have as many exercises but the learners need to have the
data downloaded or tool opened to be able to follow along. A checkpoint
could include stopping to ask what questions learners have or having
them indicate if they have completed the most recent step shown by the
instructor.</p>

<p><em>“I usually create detailed notes organised in a concept
map/workflow in order to make everything consistent. I also write next
to each bit of teaching the time approximately needed. For each lesson I
create (and reuse when I teach again the same lesson) very detailed
notes of what happens during the lesson, including teaching goals and
learning objectives I mean to achieve with each bit of lesson. This rich
lesson plan requires a lot of work the first time I teach a lesson, but
reduces a lot the preparation time of future lessons and are super
useful to other teachers.”</em></p>

<p>Create a bullet point list or brief notes describing what you will

</div>
<p>Figures and other visual aids are great tools to help participants
understand the content being presented and make associations between
pieces of information. The Instructor View of the lesson website
includes a link in the top menu to <em>Extract All Images</em>,
providing a single page containing all of the images in the lesson and
their captions: this can be useful as an alternative to a slide deck
when refering to figures and other visual aids during a workshop.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="setup-instructions">Setup Instructions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setup-instructions"></a>
</h3>
<p>If your lesson requires participants to use any software, tools or
data, it is worthwhile investing time now into creating clear download,
installation and setup instructions for participants to follow and
circulating them ahead of the workshop. This will give you more time at
the pilot for teaching the lesson as troubleshooting setup problems on
the spot can be time-consuming and stressful. Each Carpentries lesson
has a dedicated place for setup instructions within The Carpentries
Workbench located in the file <code>learners/setup.md</code> off the
lesson project root.</p>

<h3 id="instructor-notes">Instructor Notes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#instructor-notes"></a>

<p>Another standard piece of The Carpentries Workbench are the
<em>Instructor Notes</em> pages - intended to help you and other
instructors deliver your lesson by providing useful tips for how to best
run a workshop or explain “sticky” points in the lesson. Instructor
Notes for your lesson are located in the
<code>instructors/instructor-notes.md</code> file off your lesson
project root - this page is displayed in the header menu when in
“Instructor View”.</p>
<p>You may consider adding the following information to your lesson’s
Instructor Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>rationale, strengths and/or weaknesses of the lesson design</li>
<li>what has been tried before and what worked/did not work</li>
<li>tips for teaching the lesson/particular episodes</li>
<li>challenges encountered</li>
<li>troubleshooting common setup/installation/exercise issues</li>
<li>parts that seem to cause trouble or most confusion for learners
(i.e. where to tread carefully, spend more time explaining)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also add notes in a specific episode of the lesson using
fenced div with tag “instructor”. Instructors can see such notes within
the lesson and the “Instructor Notes” tab in the header menu of the
website by changing the view in the upper right-hand corner of the
lesson to “Instructor View”. These notes are hidden when in ‘Learner
View’</p>
<p>It may initially be difficult to create Instructor Notes until you
have taught the lesson yourself for the first time - but after the first
pilot you will have enough feedback to draft them.</p>

<p>The concept of <strong>hidden curriculum</strong> describes
curricular effects that influence learning but are not explicitly
addressed in the lesson content - e.g. (unofficial) social and cultural
norms, behaviours and values that are transferred by instructors to
learners, often unconsciously. These are all the additional things that
people learn about the topic from <em>the way</em> your lesson is
taught, rather than from its official content. It is worthwhile to spend
some time thinking about what learners could pick up from <em>the
way</em> your lesson is taught, as well as from its written content. You
can use Instructor Notes to guide instructors on some of the aspects of
the hidden curriculum of your lesson, e.g. to encourage them to follow
certain tried and tested practices.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There is a lot to collect feedback on when trialling a new lesson and
this is arguably the most important part of your teaching plan. It can
be hard to capture all this information yourself while you are teaching,
hence you will need help from your team - make sure you assign the
feedback collection roles ahead of your pilot. Additionally, when you
are advertising your workshop, try and make it clear to the participants
you are piloting a new lesson and that they will be actively helping you
refine it as well as learning new things themselves. This can help focus
their attention on the feedback you need to collect from them, which you
should be doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>constantly and throughout the workshop</strong>
<ul>
<li>As notes taken by an observer/co-instructor - refer to the <a href="operations.html#pilot-workshops">“Pilot Workshops” episode</a> for
suggestions on things to track and the <a href="https://codimd.carpentries.org/lesson-pilot-observation-notes-template#" class="external-link">pilot
workshop notes template</a> and other suggested feedback collection
mechanisms to help you gather such information.</li>
<li>As “minute card” feedback from learners - minute cards are short
comments from learners on what is working well and what could be
improved, provided frequently (e.g. at the end of each session). Like
exercises used as formative assessment, minute card feedback can be
provided by learners while there is still time for instructors to act on
it and adjust their approach. You may find <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p7iOV5HNvy4POS4g6eottY8RSfKq4kaoKz1-jIFYTMI/template/preview" class="external-link">the
Virtual Minute Card template</a> helpful for workshops run online, and
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback.html#minute-cards" class="external-link">the
Instructor Training curriculum describes how sticky notes can be used at
in-person events</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>at a designated wrap-up and feedback session at the end of
the workshop.</strong> Here, you can cover any other feedback that was
not addressed up to that point and any specific questions you may want
to ask your audience (e.g. about the choice of topics for the lesson,
difficulty level, workshop operations). You may design a special form
that participants can fill in anonymously - here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OGCQBotD2nOJkc7KpFZLhFfb3EBcxEDwHz_3p48qz3U/template/preview" class="external-link">post-workshop
survey template</a> for workshops that pilot a lesson in The Carpentries
Incubator. You can use it as a starting point for a post-workshop survey
to be shared with your learners at the end of the pilot workshop and you
can supplement it with additional questions.</li>

we would like you to complete the following three tasks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Teach one episode of your lesson (probably the one you have been
working on in these two days). See the <a href="trial-runs.html">Lesson
Trial Runs</a> page for full details.</li>
<li>After your trial run has concluded (immediately after, or when you
have reviewed any feedback you collected from learners), note down your
answers to the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What worked?</li>
<li>What did not?</li>
<li>What will you do differently next time?</li>
<li>What will you change in your material you taught? We will refer to
these notes when we reconvene for the last episode of this
training.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Based on your experience teaching the material and the feedback you
received from your learners and helpers, make a list of issues you have
identified with the material you prepared, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>examples that did not work as expected,</li>
<li>improvements that could be made to exercises,</li>
<li>parts that learners found particularly challenging,</li>
<li>unexpected questions or misconceptions that came up during the trial
run.</li>

<p>Recent sections of this training have focused on how to design
effective assessments and write a lesson that will be engaging and
motivating for learners. We provided further opportunities to apply
these concepts to the development of a lesson website with The
Carpentries Workbench. Next, we explored The Carpentries lesson
development ecosystem and how a new lesson project can fit into that. We
finished up with a discussion of the importance of teaching a new lesson
and how best to prepare for that experience.</p>
<p>The final sessions will focus on collaboration skills, exploring how
trainees can curate their repository and manage their project to foster
collaboration and build community around a lesson.</p>
<p>Before that, there will be an extended break during which trainees
should conduct a <em>trial run</em> of the lesson content they have been
developing in the workshop so far. When the training recommences, there
will be an opportunity for trainees to share their experiences and
reflections from those trial runs, and to discuss what impact that will
have on the next stages of their lesson development.</p>

<p>For online trainings, Trainers have found it beneficial to give

<p>Look back at the notes you took and feedback you received during your
trial run (5 mins).</p>
<p>Now report out to the other participants about that trial run. Try to
answer some or all of the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What worked well both in terms of content and delivery?</li>
<li>What did not work as well?</li>
<li>How close were your time estimates to the actual time needed to
teach the material and finish exercises?</li>
<li>How did the audience perceive the difficulty level of the
material?</li>
<li>What will you do differently next time?</li>
<li>What will you change in the material you taught?</li>
<li>What will you change in the way you collect feedback in future
pilots?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Moving forward from your first pilot, the next steps to consider
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record all the identified changes and improvements that can be made
to the lesson material and assign a person from the team responsible for
each task. The above exercise provided some reflection points after a
trial run; in terms of lesson content, they may translate into the
following considerations:
<ul>
<li>is the material too dense, does it need extra explanations?</li>
<li>would adding a diagram help explain or curate things better?</li>
<li>is there too much content for one episode, and do you need to split
it into smaller teaching units?</li>
<li>do you need to re-organise and move some content around to improve
the flow and narrative?</li>
<li>are there enough exercises and practical work?</li>
<li>do you need to realign your lesson objectives and key messages?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decide if for some of the feedback you will not take action.
Remember, you do not need to respond to every piece of feedback you
receive. For example, it is easy to fall down the rabbit hole of adding
extra material just because someone suggested it may be a useful thing -
sometimes, adding a link or a spoiler pointing to extra reading is
sufficient. You need to be able to draw a line under any extra
modification suggestions to keep you in scope and on schedule.</li>
<li>Schedule follow-up co-working sessions with your team to carry on
working on fixing issues and adding new content to maintain the
momentum.</li>
<li>Add/Update your lessons’ Instructor Notes based on what you learned
and to help other instructors who will teach your lesson in the
future.</li>
<li>Think about the timeline for your next pilot(s), even provisionally,
to help you set milestones and targets to work towards.</li>
<li>Consider writing up your pilot experience in a mini blog post that
you can share with the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Designing and developing quality lessons is hard - there are many
pieces of a puzzle that have to come into place: both pedagogical and
organisational. Do not be disheartened with the amount and type of
feedback you may have received. Even Carpentries lessons that have been
around for 10+ years receive improvement suggestions and fixes almost
daily. From our experience, bigger lessons that are delivered over a few
days require several full pilots before they can even be considered for
a <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/the-lesson-life-cycle.html" class="external-link">beta</a>
release. Planning smaller lesson trials (where you test only a portion
of a lesson) and doing them more often with a friendly audience from
your local groups and close colleagues is more manageable and will help
you make steady progress.</p>

<p>In this episode we expand on how to use GitHub effectively among a
group of known collaborators, currently your lesson development group,
on an open source lesson development project, setting the stage for
introducing tools and practices for working with newcomers. Here, we
explore GitHub features to help you keep track of what needs doing on
the lesson, manage contributions and prioritise work. Making decisions
and managing your project as a whole will be covered in a follow-up
episode on <a href="./project-management.html">project management</a>.
Collaboration skills covered in this and follow-up episodes are
transferable to any similar open source project you may be involved
with.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="managing-issues">Managing Issues<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#managing-issues"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p><strong>Issues</strong> are GitHub’s framework for managing issue/bug
reports, feature requests, and lists of future work. They provide a
single shared record of all the problems people have found with the
lesson, and improvements that could be made, along with solutions and
discussions around them. This helps the team to keep track of what they
need to work on later, and reduces the chance of receiving redundant
reports of issues you already know about.</p>
<p>When you create an issue, you can add a range of details to it. An
issue can be assigned to a specific team member - this can be a helpful
way to know who is currently working to fix an issue or a way to assign
responsibility. You can assign one or more labels to issues to classify
or group them. Labels can also be given colours, allowing you to see at
a glance from the Issues page the state of your project.</p>
<p>Lesson repositories created from the template are configured with <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/maintainers/github_labels.html" class="external-link">The
Carpentries standard set of labels</a>, which are designed to help
lesson developers and maintainers to indicate the type and current
status of issues. Some of the most frequently used labels include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>type:bug</code> - indicates something that is broken in the
lesson, e.g. a factual error or broken link</li>
<li>
<code>type:enhancement</code> - indicates that the issue is
proposing a way for the lesson to be improved</li>
<li>
<code>type:accessibility</code> - indicates that the issue relates
to the accessibility of the lesson</li>
<li>
<code>status:wait</code> - indicates that the issue cannot or will
not be worked on until something else is resolved, e.g. the solution to
the issue is dependent on another change yet to be made (see also:
<code>status:blocked</code>)</li>
<li>
<code>status:waiting for response</code> - indicates that further
progress cannot be made until someone (usually the person who submitted
the issue) has responded</li>
<li>
<code>status:in progress</code> - indicates that someone is working
on a resolution for the issue, preventing potentially redundant efforts
from being made by others</li>
<li>
<code>good first issue</code> - indicates that the issue requires
relatively little knowledge of the project to fix, making it a good
choice for first-time contributors</li>
<li>
<code>help wanted</code> - indicates that a maintainer wants help on
an issue or pull request</li>
</ul>
<p>GitHub provides a default set of labels for repositories which can be
used “as is” or customised (as done by The Carpentries above) - check
the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels" class="external-link">GitHub
documentation on Issues</a> for the full reference. You can also create
your own custom labels to help with classifying issues.</p>
<p>If you are developing your lesson in <a href="https://carpentries-incubator.org/" class="external-link">The Carpentries Incubator</a>,
you can register the repository for inclusion in The Carpentries <a href="https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/" class="external-link">Help Wanted Issues
page</a>, which will list all issues labeled with
<code>help wanted</code> and/or <code>good first issue</code>. Issues
listed on this page are more visible to the wider Carpentries community,
making it a good way to attract spontaneous contributions from
newcomers.</p>

<p>After your trial run, you should have created a list of issues you
identified with your lesson. Open issues on the GitHub repository for
your lesson, for each item on that list. Remember to add labels to each
issue according to its type, priority, etc. As you create them, you may
also want to assign these issues to a member of your lesson development
team.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Although it is possible (for collaborators with sufficient access to
the project) to make changes to a lesson directly on the
<code>main</code> branch of the repository, doing so is not
recommended:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It increases the likelihood of unintentional conflicts being created
when two collaborators work on the same file simultaneously.</li>
<li>It does not provide an opportunity for changes to be checked and
discussed before they are included in the lesson. This makes it much
more likely that mistakes will be included in the lesson, and that the
commit history of the project will include many changes made only to
fix/polish/undo previous commits.</li>
<li>It prevents your team from benefiting from the powerful features
that Git and GitHub provide to support and foster collaboration.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead, it is recommended practice to do most work in
<em>branches</em>: sets of changes that build on the work in the
<code>main</code> branch (or another) but are not included in that
branch until they are explicitly <em>merged</em> into it. GitHub
provides a way for this merging process to be managed, by giving a
platform for the changes to be described, discussed and reviewed, before
a decision is made to integrate or not integrate the changes in the
default branch of the project and the associated lesson. On GitHub,
these units of discussion, review, and acceptance/rejection of the
changes within a branch are called <em>Pull Requests</em>.</p>

<div id="collapseSpoiler1" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionSpoiler1" aria-labelledby="headingSpoiler1">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>The term <em>Pull Request</em> originates from the early days of
GitHub, when a contributor would be requesting that the project
maintainer(s) use Git to fetch (download) their branch and merge the
changes into the main branch of the project. In the terminology of Git,
this combination of fetching and merging a set of changes is called
<em>pulling</em>. The name Pull Request is slightly anachronistic now,
because a project maintainer can often manage the whole process of
reviewing a contribution in GitHub’s web interface.</p>
<p>Note: A common nickname for a <em>Pull Request</em> is PR or PRs for
<em>Pull Requests</em>.</p>

<p>Making effective review comments in a PR is something you will get
better at with practice - here is some general guidance to help with
reviewing a PR from a collaborator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good reviews have empathy - consider the contributor’s feelings,
identify positives and try not to be judgemental.</li>
<li>Aim for improved/better rather than perfect.</li>
<li>Make sure your review comments are specific and actionable.</li>
<li>Make it clear in the comment what you want changed as part of a PR
and, ideally, provide a concrete suggestion.</li>
<li>Only request changes if the content is wrong or hard to understand
(remember, different does not always mean better).</li>
<li>If a conversation on a PR hasn’t been resolved by one or two
back-and-forth exchanges, consider scheduling a meeting to discuss
further.</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Having an open, publicly-visible list of all the issues with your
project is a helpful way of letting people know you are aware of issues
and you are working on them. This can indicate to an external audience
that the project is active. It also provides you and your collaborators
with an “at a glance” view of the state of the project, making it easier
to prioritise future work.</p>
<p>GitHub provides a useful notification feature for collaborative work
- <em>mentions</em>. The mention system notifies team members when
somebody else references them in an issue, comment or pull request - you
can use this to notify people when you want to check a detail with them,
or let them know something has been fixed or changed (much easier than
writing out all the same information again in an email!). You can use
the mention system to notify individual GitHub accounts or whole teams
(when you need to mention multiple people at once and it is not
practical to list them all individually). Typing <code>@</code> in
GitHub will bring up a list of all accounts and teams linked to the
repository that can be “mentioned”. You can also mention people who
aren’t linked with the repository but they won’t be listed in the
<code>@</code> drop-down list so you will need to know their GitHub
username in order to mention them.</p>
<p><a href="https://slack.com/" class="external-link">Slack</a> is commonly used in the
Carpentries community for quick, day-to-day message exchange among
teams. You can create a channel for your lesson development project
under <a href="https://carpentries.slack.com/" class="external-link">the Carpentries public
Slack workspace</a> or if you need more complex team communications you
can create your own <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/" class="external-link">Slack
workspace for free</a>. Note that the Carpentries Slack is an enterprise
workspace so all messages and files will be retained and no messages
will be lost (for free workspaces only the most recent 10,000 messages
can be viewed and searched and file storage limit is 5 GB).</p>
<p>Collaborators can also use other platforms to discuss lesson
development or receive contributions from newcomers who are not yet
fluent in using GitHub’s systems of communication. The Carpentries can
assist with creating a mailing list specific to the development of your
lesson on their <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/" class="external-link">TopicBox</a>
platform for managing threaded email discussions. Also make sure to join
the <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/incubator-developers" class="external-link">Incubator
lesson developers mailing list</a> on TopicBox to keep an eye on
announcements and discussions relating to lesson development in general
within the Carpentries community.</p>

<p>You may start working on projects by yourself or with a small group
of collaborators you already know, but open source projects in the
Carpentries community often grow beyond that small group. Community
collaboration is the cornerstone of The Carpentries - all curricula and
various programmes are developed together by the community members
across borders, domains and backgrounds. Most initiatives are done
through community consultation and collaboration is used as a pathway to
empower people, give members a sense of purpose in the community and
realise shared goals.</p>
<p>Collaboration helps bring different perspectives to solving a problem
and share the load of the required work to develop, pilot, and, later
on, maintain the lesson. People drop in and out of projects for various
reasons and their levels of involvement may vary over time due to other
commitments - for this reason it is worth taking time from the outset to
make a project welcoming for newcomers in order to achieve a steady
number of people working on your project at any time. You should plan to
make it easy for new collaborators to join, to set up a local workspace
so that they can contribute, help them find tasks so that they know what
to contribute, and make the contribution process clear so that they know
how to contribute. You also want to make it easy to give people credit
for their work on your project as well as for others to reuse and give
credit to your project. In this episode, we cover best practices for
collaborating with newcomers and tools available to help. And remember,
anything you do to make it easier for newcomers to contribute will be <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/09-eia.html#from-accommodation-to-universal-design" class="external-link">universally
useful for all collaborators</a>.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="documenting-your-lesson">Documenting Your Lesson<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#documenting-your-lesson"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>For collaborative projects, it is important to spend the time on
‘external-facing’ features, such as documentation, to make the project
as welcoming and as easy to get involved in as possible for newcomers
who may not have a deep grasp of the project or know all its existing
problems. Such documentation will be useful to yourself and other team
members as well, e.g. if you are trying to come back to the project
after a break or are reusing it for a new collaboration in the
future.</p>
<p>Your lesson documentation should contain the following information,
which should be kept up to date.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="readme">Description of the Project - <code>README</code> File<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#readme"></a>
</h3>
<p><code>README</code>, <code>README.txt</code> or
<code>README.md</code> is a plain text or Markdown file located in the
project’s root directory representing the default landing or home page
for repositories in GitHub (and similar project repositories) by
convention. It represents the first piece of documentation that people
will see when visiting your lesson repository, hence it should concisely
explain what the lesson is about and who it is for, and contain links
and pointers to further information. For example, <code>README</code>
should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>lesson title</strong></li>
<li><strong>lesson description</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>rendered version of the lesson</strong> - even though this
is typically included in the <code>About</code> section of the
repository, it is always useful to link to the URL where the rendered
lesson is available</li>
<li>
<strong>contact information</strong> - include up-to-date email
addresses or mailing lists or other details on how to get in touch with
the lesson maintainers</li>
<li>
<strong>contributing information</strong> - this is an opportunity
to list what kinds of contributions are sought (and what are not) and
how to get involved in lesson development for new contributors. You can
provide more details in a separate <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> file within
the repository’s root directory and link to it from
<code>README</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>credits/acknowledgements</strong> - make sure to credit
those who have helped in the lesson’s development or inspired it, and/or
any resources/templates that you have reused. You can also link to a
separate <code>AUTHORS.md</code> file within the repository’s root
directory to list all the people who contributed to the lesson content
(if this list starts to become too large to include in the
<code>README</code> itself)</li>
<li>
<strong>citation</strong> - a convention is to include the citation
information for your lesson in a separate <code>CITATION</code> file
within the repository’s root directory and link to it from
<code>README.md</code> so others can cite the use of the lesson in their
own publications and media and it can also be automatically discovered
by other applications. These <code>CITATION</code> files are discussed
in more detail below.</li>
<li>
<strong>license</strong> - a short description of and a link to the
lesson’s license typically contained in a separate <code>LICENSE</code>,
<code>LICENSE.txt</code> or <code>LICENSE.md</code> file within the
repository’s root directory. The lesson repository created from the
Carpentries lesson template already contains a default
<code>LICENSE.md</code> file, but you should modify this to more
accurately describe how the lesson content can be re-used by
others.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="helping-people-cite-your-lesson">Helping People Cite Your Lesson<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#helping-people-cite-your-lesson"></a>
</h3>
<p>The default citation file for new lessons using The Carpentries
Workbench is <code>CITATION.cff</code>, in <a href="https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format" class="external-link">Citation
File Format (CFF)</a>. CFF is defined using <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/" class="external-link">YAML</a> (which we already
encountered in the <code>config.yaml</code> file for the lesson website)
and is <a href="https://github.blog/2021-08-19-enhanced-support-citations-github/" class="external-link">the
recommended way of storing citations in GitHub</a>. If your lesson
repository contains a <code>CITATION.cff</code> file, GitHub will
automatically show the citation information in the sidebar, making it
more visible and accessible for visitors to your repository. CFF is also
recognised and supported by other platforms including <a href="https://zenodo.org/" class="external-link">Zenodo</a> and the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" class="external-link">Zotero reference manager</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>CITATION.cff</code> file for newly-created lessons contains
only placeholder information, which should be replaced with relevant
details for your project as soon as practical. Citation information can
also be contained in a plain text file (<code>CITATION</code>,
<code>CITATION.txt</code>) or a Markdown file
(<code>CITATION.md</code>). In all cases, it is up to the lesson
developers to decide what information to include in their citation
file.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="digital-object-identifiers">Digital Object Identifiers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#digital-object-identifiers"></a>
</h4>
<p>We recommend that you obtain a <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-steps.html?highlight=doi#dois" class="external-link">Digital
Object Identifier (DOI)</a> for your lesson as soon as feels
appropriate, at the latest when the lesson reaches the beta phase. You
can use this DOI in the citation information (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md#identifiers" class="external-link">in
the <code>identifiers</code> field of your
<code>CITATION.cff</code></a>), to allow people to cite a particular
version of your lesson, e.g. a snapshot of the lesson when it entered
beta testing, captured as a Zenodo record.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="contributing">Instructions for Contributors - <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> File<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#contributing"></a>
</h3>
<p><code>CONTRIBUTING</code>, <code>CONTRIBUTING.txt</code> or
<code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> is a text or Markdown file within the
repository’s root directory where you should provide detailed
description of the ways people can send their contributions, what kinds
of contribution will be credited and in what ways. For example, at what
point would someone be listed as an author and how you will credit
contributions that are not recorded in the commit history of the
project. The latter is particularly important for newcomers who may not
be proficient with the use of GitHub’s features for collaborative work,
such as issues, mentions, pull requests and code review, but could still
provide valuable input and contributions.</p>
<p>Carpentries lesson repositories already have a generic Carpentries
<code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file to get you started. You should review
it and, if need be, modify it to fit your team’s needs and way of
working. For example, you may want to expand on what contributions you
are <em>not</em> looking for if your lesson already contains more
material than can be covered in a typical workshop. You can also detail
all channels on which you are willing to receive contributions on, if
they are different from the defaults included in the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="issue-templates">Issue and Pull Request Templates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#issue-templates"></a>
</h3>
<p>Consider setting up <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository" class="external-link">issue
and pull request templates</a> to help newcomers who may not have much
experience working on collaborative projects in GitHub. Such templates
can provide a structure for the issue/pull request description, and/or
prompt them to fill in answers to pre-set questions. Both can help
contributors raise issues or submit pull requests in a way that is
clear, helpful and provides enough information for maintainers to act
upon (without going back and forth to extract it). GitHub provides a
range of default templates, but you can also <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository" class="external-link">write
your own</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have set up the basic documentation about your lesson, you
may consider adding the following useful information to your
documentation too:</p>
<ul>
<li>set-up guides for installing and rendering the lesson locally. In
most cases, a link to <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/" class="external-link">The Carpentries

<p>In addition to having the complete documentation in the lesson
repository, The Carpentries community provides a number of ways to
further raise the visibility of the lesson among the broader community
and encourage community members to contribute to its further
development. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>listing issues from the lesson repository on <a href="https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/" class="external-link">The Carpentries Help

</li>
<li>featuring your lesson in <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/spotlight.html" class="external-link">the

</li>
<li>writing a blog post about the lesson for <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog" class="external-link">The Carpentries Blog</a>, and/or
attending a community discussion call to promote the lesson</li>
<li>advertising the lesson at various Carpentries mailing lists -

discussion</a>, <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors" class="external-link">instructors</a>,
regional communities or specific curriculum lists</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider including your lesson in <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/" class="external-link">Hacktoberfest</a> and
similar wider community open source events aimed at encouraging people
to contribute to open source projects periodically throughout the

use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>All GitHub notifications are sent from the address
<code>notifications@github.com</code>.</li>
<li>Notification emails are sent to the address
<code>repo-name@noreply.github.com</code>, where <code>repo-name</code>
is the name of the repository where the notification was triggered.</li>
<li>The email subject begins with <code>[org-or-user/repo-name]</code>,
where <code>org-or-user</code> is the name of the organisation or the
username of the user who owns the repository and <code>repo-name</code>
is the name of the repository where the notification was triggered.</li>
<li>In addition to your email address, the cc field of the message
contains an address that describes the type of event that triggered the
notification, e.g. <code>author@noreply.github.com</code> for activity

<p>The alternative to using email to keep track of project activity is
to manage notifications on GitHub. Adjust how you receive notifications
in <a href="https://github.com/settings/notifications" class="external-link">the
<em>Notifications</em> section of your account settings</a>. When logged
in, you can visit <a href="https://github.com/notifications" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/notifications</a> to see notifications
for your account, presented as a table. Through this interface, you
can:</p>
<ul>
<li>group notifications by repository.</li>
<li>see notifications for a particular repository.</li>
<li>see particular types of notification e.g. mentions, issue
assignments, etc.</li>
<li>create more sophisticated filters using the search bar, e.g. all
mentions for all repositories in a particular organisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The account notification settings allow you to specify certain types
of notification that should be sent by email, while everything else is
collected in the web interface. Whatever strategy you choose, one of the
most important habits that will help you stay on top of your projects
and tasks is to remember to check these notifications frequently.</p>

<p>Not every contribution is a good fit for a project and, especially as
your lesson becomes more stable, you probably will not want to accept
every suggested change. If you receive a pull request or issue that does
not fit to your lesson, consider the following points to help you
politely decline without demotivating the contributor from contributing
to your lesson (or another open source project) again:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Thank them</strong> for taking the time to contribute.</li>
<li>
<strong>Explain why the contribution does not fit</strong> into the
lesson, and offer suggestions for improvement if you’re able to.</li>
<li>
<strong>Link to relevant documentation</strong>, if you have it.
Notes about the design of the lesson (e.g. from this training) and any
relevant discussion threads can be very helpful here. If you notice
similar repeated requests/contributions, you might want to address them
in your documentation (e.g. in the <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file) to
save yourself time in future.</li>
<li>
<strong>Close the request</strong>.</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Developing a lesson is a project and, like most projects, it consists
of multiple tasks. Keeping track of the list of tasks the team has to
do, progress on each, prioritising tasks for future development, sprints
and releases, etc., quickly becomes a non-trivial task in itself.
Without a project management tool/framework, it can be hard to keep
track of what’s done, or what needs doing, and particularly difficult to
convey that to others in the team or share the responsibilities.</p>
<p>Different tools and platforms exist to help you with project planning
and management - for example, GitHub’s <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones" class="external-link"><strong>Milestones</strong></a>
and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects" class="external-link"><strong>Projects</strong></a>,

Different tools will work best for different teams of collaborators, but
making sure you use any tool to plan and manage work on your lesson
development project is better than making it up as you go along.</p>

<h3 id="project-management-in-github">Project Management in GitHub<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#project-management-in-github"></a>
</h3>
<p>Carpentries lessons are developed in GitHub so it is convenient (but
not a must) to use GitHub’s Milestones and Projects to help you keep
track of different components of the project and their current
status.</p>
<p>Milestones are a way of organising issues on your project into
smaller units of work (e.g. deliverables) that have deadlines and
progress of which needs to be closely tracked (e.g. release management).
Projects provide a way of visualising and organising the work on a
higher level and are more suitable for project management tasks that are
more continuous and not time-bound. While a Milestone is associated with
a single repository, a Project can span over multiple Milestones and
even different repositories within an organisation in GitHub.</p>

<p>For a good description of differences between the two, have a look at

<p>A Milestone answers the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“What is remaining to finish off this task?”</em></p>

<p>A Project answers the question:</p>

<p><em>“What (tasks) are we working on at the moment?”</em></p>

<p>Milestones are good for managing time-bound, structured iterations
and working in short sprints on batches of issues. Dedicated sprints
seem to work well for lesson development, so we will have a look at how
Milestones can help with this. We recommend you to also have a look at
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects" class="external-link">GitHub’s
documentation on Projects</a> and see if they are suitable for your

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="githubs-milestones">GitHub’s Milestones<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#githubs-milestones"></a>

<p>A Milestone is a collection of issues to be worked on in a given time
period. Milestones are good for tracking progress as they provide an
ordered list of issues which must all be resolved for the overall task
to be considered complete. Milestones work like labels - they mark and
group issues that are expected to be closed at some point in time.</p>
<p>The <code>Milestones</code> page in GitHub is accessible from the
<code>Issues</code> or <code>Pull requests</code> pages - from there you
can create a new Milestone, set its description and due date, sort all
Milestones by due date and see the percentage of issues completed for
your Milestones. Within an individual Milestone’s page, you can see the
list of associated issues and prioritise them by pointing to the left of
an issue until the ‘hand’ pointer appears and then drag-and-dropping it
to a new location in the list (with higher position in the list
indicating higher priority). Back on the
<code>Issues</code>/<code>Pull requests</code> page, you can assign
issues/pull requests to a Milestone and filter your issues/pull requests
by Milestones.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Use Milestones to prioritise issues and plan the first sprint and/or
the first lesson release with your team.</p>
<p>Depending on how many issues were registered on your repository, it
is possible that you will not be able to work on all the issues in the
first sprint. As the development of your lesson progresses, any
remaining unresolved issues can be reconsidered and prioritised for
another sprint/milestone.</p>
<p>This process of receiving new issues and requirements,
prioritisation, and working on them is naturally continuous - with the
benefit that at key stages your team is repeatedly re-evaluating what is
important and needs to be worked on which helps to ensure real concrete
progress against project goals and requirements which may change over
time.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In addition to managing your project on a day-to-day basis, you
should consider a governance model for your lesson to describe the
ground rules of participation, the roles that project participants can
take on and the process for decision making within the project. You may
wonder why you’d ever need a formal governance process - after all,
everyone in your team is collegial, polite and hard-working. However,
even among the most harmonious teams you will likely realise you need an
agreed way to make decisions and resolve conflicts when your team
encounters their first real disagreement<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The moment your collaborator group exceeds 3 or 4 members (and fewer
if the collaborators do not all know each other equally well at the
outset) you should establish and document some kind of governance
process. It will help mitigate any power imbalances which are expressed
when one team member (or a group of team members) are more vocal and are
able to dominate the decision-making process. It is advised to make
these considerations early on, before your project grows too much and
introducing structure and process into it becomes more difficult and
complicated. Besides, if you do not establish these processes from the
start, you are likely to discover the need to do so only when you first
encounter disagreement within the team: a situation unlikely to provide
perfect conditions for a discussion of governance.</p>
<p>Here are some aspects of governing a project that you should
consider. These are borrowed from <a href="https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/teams.html" class="external-link">the <em>Working in
teams</em> chapter</a> of <a href="https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/index.html" class="external-link"><em>Research

consider the following:</p>

<li>
<a href="https://github.com/github/MVG" class="external-link">GitHub’s Minimum Viable
Governance</a> (MVG) for establishing a lightweight governance process
into free and open source projects that are run in version control
systems.
<ul>
<li>In MVG decisions are made through consensus of the project
maintainers or determined based on the maintainers’ consideration of a
number of factors in “good faith” (when explicit agreement of all
maintainers cannot be reached). In reality, consensus-based governance
can run you into trouble when you hit an issue where maintainers do not
all agree but still want to make progress. Also, the definition of “good
faith” is open to interpretation and leaves plenty of room for people,
especially the powerful, to get away with acting in bad faith.</li>
<li>A system based on voting and majorities may help you get around this
issue. MVG is designed for a one organisation-many projects setup and is
too elaborate for a single lesson project. However, it includes
“boilerplate” template files for a steering committee, charter,
governance, Code of Conduct documents, and language laying out a
preference for consensus but with voting as a fallback, and other
templates that may be helpful for those starting out and unsure about
how to get on with establishing a governance process.</li>

<ul>
<li>Being intentional about task/project management for your lesson
development project is better than making it up as you go along.</li>
<li>Different tools and platforms exist to help you with project
management - chose one that suits your team best.</li>
<li>Dedicated work sprints seem to work well for lesson development and
GitHub’s <strong>Milestones</strong> can be used effectively to plan and
manage such sprints.</li>
<li>Make sure to consider and establish a governance model for your
project early on - to describe the ground rules of participation and the
process for decision making within the project.</li>

<p>Throughout this training we promoted a collaborative approach to
lesson development (as many other initiatives in The Carpentries
community are conducted). Collaboration helps bring different skills and
perspectives to a project and share the load of the work required to
bring the project successfully past the finishing line. For lesson
projects, this shared effort also extends to maintaining and updating
the lesson after the initial development phase.</p>

</h3>
<p>While you will know the best collaboration practices for your team,
here are some suggestions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Provide ‘external-facing’ features for your lesson (such as
description, objectives, contribution and ‘how to get involved’ guides,
preferred way of communication) - these will be universally useful for
everyone coming to your repository (your team included).</li>
<li>Find the best tools that work for your team for communication,
documentation and knowledge sharing, issue &amp; project
management.</li>
<li>Document and share knowledge within the team to facilitate team
collaboration. Share decisions and communicate with your team
synchronously and asynchronously.</li>
<li>Plan your meetings to get the most out of your team (e.g. set
agenda, assign meeting roles - chair, note-taker, time-keeper, etc.) and
be appreciative of people’s times.</li>
<li>Record and manage issues with your lesson as you develop, trial and
maintain it (e.g. assign people responsible for issues, categorise and
prioritise them).</li>
<li>Assign tasks and roles to distribute the responsibilities - this
includes assigning larger roles (project management &amp; governance) to
team members and assigning specific issues/tasks to collaborators.
Progress is much more likely to be made when people know what they and
others should be working on.</li>
<li>Dedicated sprints where the whole team works on a set of issues
towards a milestone work well for lesson development and making progress
on projects in general.</li>
<li>Be open and welcoming to new contributors and provide different
opportunities to get involved with your project (from novice to expert
collaborators). Point to upskilling guides (or run upskilling sessions
if possible) to bring people up to speed.</li>
<li>Manage contributions in a timely manner by noticing when things
happen and responding to new issues, comments and Pull Requests (PRs).
Show appreciation for everyone’s contributions.</li>
<li>People bring different perspectives, expertise and skills to a
collaborative project and, while they can be productive and harmoniously
complement each other, having some decision making and conflict
resolution process in place will make sure progress can be made when
disagreements arise.</li>

<p>By now, you should have made good progress towards a first draft of
your lesson.</p>
<p>Referring back to <a href="operations.html">the life cycle stages for
lessons</a> described earlier in the curriculum, your lesson is still in
<em>pre-alpha</em> but hopefully approaching <em>alpha</em>, when it is
ready to be taught in full for the first time.</p>
<p>As you and your collaborators continue to iterate over the lesson -
teaching it, gathering feedback, reflecting on the experience, and
improving it for next time - the lesson will pass through <em>alpha</em>
into the <em>beta</em> and <em>stable</em> stages (perhaps via <a href="https://carpentries-lab.org/" class="external-link">peer review in The Carpentries
Lab</a>).</p>
<p>Your role as the original developers of the lesson, and the kind of
interactions/contributions taking place on your repository, will change
as you move through these stages.</p>

<p>Thank you for following this training. We hope you found it helpful
to build a foundation for your current lesson project and to prepare you
to collaborate on other projects in the future.</p>

activities to gather feedback and help you reflect on the
experience.</p>

<li>Say only one thing, and try not to duplicate. This gets harder for

<p>Take this time to reflect on what you have learned in this last part

the development of your lesson after you leave. It is up to you how you
use this time, but you might find some inspiration in the prompts
below.</p>
<ul>
<li>How could you use the project management features of GitHub to
prepare for the next stage of the lesson development process?</li>
<li>If you have been working in a collaborative group, what steps could
your group take to improve the way you work together for the remainder
of the project?</li>
<li>If you have been working on the lesson alone so far, what steps
could you take to find new collaborators to help you with the further
development of your lesson?</li>
<li>Based on the experience of teaching a section of your lesson, do the
objectives you wrote for your lesson still seem realistic? Can you
identify anything that can be added or removed now that you have
completed a trial run?</li>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.

    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
