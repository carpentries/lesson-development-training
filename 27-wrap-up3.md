## Looking Ahead

We have reached the end of this training.
By now, you should have made good progress towards a first draft of your lesson.

Referring back to [the life cycle stages for lessons](19-operations.md) 
described earlier in the curriculum, 
your lesson is still in _pre-alpha_ but hopefully approaching _alpha_,
when it is ready to be taught in full for the first time.

As you and your collaborators continue to iterate over the lesson -
teaching it, gathering feedback, reflecting on the experience, 
and improving it for next time -
the lesson will pass through _alpha_ into the _beta_ and _stable_ stages
(perhaps via [peer review in The Carpentries Lab][carpentries-lab]).

Your role as the original developers of the lesson,
and the kind of interactions/contributions taking place on your repository,
will change as you move through these stages.

| Life cycle stage | Type of contribution | Your role |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| pre-alpha        | new content and whole new episodes; changes/additions to lesson objectives | active development; onboarding new collaborators; project management |
| alpha            | improving existing content; adding/expanding/removing content; polishing changes/typo fixes | active development; reviewing changes; documenting feedback/actions based on pilot workshops; project management |
| beta             | feedback from pilot workshops; polishing changes; expanding instructor notes; suggestions for major overhauls/reorganisations | recruiting pilot instructors; reviewing changes; guiding contributors |
| stable           | feedback from workshops; polishing changes; new/updated content | reviewing changes; guiding contributors; onboarding new maintainers; stepping away from the project |

## Farewell and Feedback

Thank you for following this training.
We hope you found it helpful to build a foundation for your current lesson project
and to prepare you to collaborate on other projects in the future.

To bring the training to a close, 
the Trainers will lead a number of activities to gather feedback 
and help you reflect on the experience.

::: challenge

## One Up, One Down (10 min)

Provide one up, one down feedback on the entire Collaborative Lesson Development Training. 
Remember:

- Say only one thing, and try not to duplicate.
  This gets harder for those who come later!
- Trainers should try not to respond, only record responses (e.g. in the Etherpad). 
  This is also hard, but important!

# Reflection exercise (15 min)

Take this time to reflect on what you have learned in this last part of the training,
and take some action to plan to successfully complete the development of your lesson
after you leave.
It is up to you how you use this time, but you might find some inspiration in the prompts below.

- How could you use the project management features of GitHub to 
  prepare for the next stage of the lesson development process?
- If you have been working in a collaborative group,
  what steps could your group take to improve the way you work together
  for the remainder of the project?
- If you have been working on the lesson alone so far,
  what steps could you take to find new collaborators to help you 
  with the further development of your lesson?
- Based on the experience of teaching a section of your lesson,
  do the objectives you wrote for your lesson still seem realistic?
  Can you identify anything that can be added or removed 
  now that you have completed a trial run?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Documenting your lesson project, curating your lesson repository, welcoming new contributions, and taking advantage of GitHub's project management features all make it easier for people to collaborate with you.
- Any lesson can be improved with feedback, including this one.
