abstract: >
  A training curriculum teaching good practices in lesson
  design and development, and open source collaboration
  skills, using The Carpentries Workbench. The curriculum is
  designed to be taught over six half-days. The target
  audience is Carpentries Instructors with an idea for a new
  lesson they would like to create, especially if that
  lesson is intended for short-format training (e.g. part or
  all of a two-day workshop).

  We believe that lesson development is easier and more
  successful when it is a joint effort among collaborators,
  so the activities and examples used in this training are
  best suited to groups of trainees who want to collaborate
  on a lesson project. Efforts have been made to also cater
  to lesson developers working alone.

  After attending this training, participants will be able
  to:

  * collaboratively develop and publish lessons using The
  Carpentries lesson infrastructure (aka The Carpentries
  Workbench): lesson template, GitHub, GitHub Pages, etc.

  * identify and characterise the target audience for a
  lesson.

  * define SMART learning objectives.

  * explain the pedagogical value of authentic tasks.

  * create exercises for formative assessment.

  * explain how considerations of cognitive load can
  influence the pacing, length, and organisation of a
  lesson.

  * configure and maintain accessible and usable lesson
  repositories using best practices, readily available for
  collaboration.

  * identify and correct accessibility issues in a
  Carpentries lesson.

  * update and improve lesson material guided by feedback
  and reflection from teaching.

  * review and provide constructive feedback on lessons.
